1
00:00:25.326 --> 00:00:28.352
-So, your boy's name is what?
-Snot.

2
00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:32.495
-You called the guy Snot?
-Snotboogie, yeah.

3
00:00:32.967 --> 00:00:34.161
"Snotboogie."

4
00:00:35.102 --> 00:00:36.433
He like the name?

5
00:00:36.537 --> 00:00:38.835
-What?
-Snotboogie.

6
00:00:41.242 --> 00:00:45.542
This kid whose mama went to the trouble
of christening him Omar lsaiah Betts?

7
00:00:46.681 --> 00:00:49.206
You know, he forgets his jacket...

8
00:00:50.885 --> 00:00:54.685
so his nose starts running,
and some asshole...

9
00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:57.417
instead of giving him a Kleenex,
he calls him "Snot."

10
00:00:58.492 --> 00:01:00.392
So, he's "Snot" forever.

11
00:01:02.496 --> 00:01:04.088
Doesn't seem fair.

12
00:01:04.198 --> 00:01:06.063
Life just be that way, I guess.

13
00:01:10.004 --> 00:01:11.471
So who shot Snot?

14
00:01:11.572 --> 00:01:13.267
I ain't going to no court.

15
00:01:21.882 --> 00:01:24.248
Motherfucker ain't have
to put no cap in him though.

16
00:01:24.352 --> 00:01:25.376
Definitely not.

17
00:01:25.486 --> 00:01:28.319
He could've just whipped his ass,
like we always whip his ass.

18
00:01:28.422 --> 00:01:30.413
-I agree with you.
-He gonna kill Snot.

19
00:01:30.524 --> 00:01:33.391
Snot been doing the same shit
since I don't know how long.

20
00:01:33.494 --> 00:01:35.962
Kill a man over some bullshit.

21
00:01:38.766 --> 00:01:42.361
I'm saying, every Friday night...

22
00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.337
in the alley behind the cut-rate,
we rolling bones, you know?

23
00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:48.101
All the boys from around the way,
we roll till late.

24
00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:49.699
Alley crap game, right?

25
00:01:50.077 --> 00:01:54.878
And like every time,
Snot, he'd fade a few shooters.

26
00:01:55.182 --> 00:01:58.913
Play it out till the pot's deep.
Then he'd snatch and run.

27
00:02:00.488 --> 00:02:03.548
-Every time?
-Couldn't help hisself.

28
00:02:04.925 --> 00:02:06.290
Let me understand you.

29
00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.688
Every Friday night,
you and your boys would shoot crap, right?

30
00:02:09.797 --> 00:02:12.265
And every Friday night,
your pal Snotboogie...

31
00:02:12.633 --> 00:02:17.002
he'd wait till there was cash on the ground,
then grab the money and run away?

32
00:02:17.505 --> 00:02:20.201
-You let him do that?
-We catch him and beat his ass.

33
00:02:20.307 --> 00:02:22.298
But ain't nobody ever go past that.

34
00:02:24.779 --> 00:02:26.406
I gotta ask you.

35
00:02:27.181 --> 00:02:31.117
If every time Snotboogie
would grab the money and run away...

36
00:02:32.686 --> 00:02:34.586
why'd you even let him in the game?

37
00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:35.881
What?

38
00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.651
If Snotboogie always stole the money,
why'd you let him play?

39
00:02:40.795 --> 00:02:43.525
Got to. This America, man.

40
00:04:28.636 --> 00:04:30.331
-Guess what he says.
-What?

41
00:04:30.471 --> 00:04:32.302
"Gotta let him play, this America."

42
00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:33.629
No fucking way.

43
00:04:33.741 --> 00:04:35.732
-Would I make it up?
-He give you the shooter?

44
00:04:35.843 --> 00:04:38.004
Three Newports and a Grape Nehi
he's grand juried.

45
00:04:38.112 --> 00:04:41.047
It's down, Bunk.
Barksdale's in Part 1 2, right?

46
00:04:41.315 --> 00:04:42.612
Project murder, Westside.

47
00:04:42.716 --> 00:04:44.911
-Which one, now?
-Never mind.

48
00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:48.620
Gonna sit in on it for a bit.
Where you gonna be?

49
00:04:48.722 --> 00:04:51.691
I'm gonna drop this off on Nathan,
then I'm going to the office.

50
00:04:51.792 --> 00:04:54.955
-Don't answer no phones, Bunk.
-Yeah, yeah.

51
00:04:56.864 --> 00:04:59.526
And is that your signature
on that photo array card?

52
00:05:00.167 --> 00:05:01.156
Yes.

53
00:05:01.268 --> 00:05:04.795
And those are your initials as well,
next to the photo you identified?

54
00:05:04.905 --> 00:05:06.202
Yes.

55
00:05:06.407 --> 00:05:11.037
Mr. Gant, do you see the man you identified
from that photo array card...

56
00:05:11.912 --> 00:05:13.573
sitting in the courtroom today?

57
00:05:27.261 --> 00:05:28.888
He's right there.

58
00:05:29.063 --> 00:05:32.032
For the record, the witness
has identified the defendant...

59
00:05:32.132 --> 00:05:33.724
D'Angelo Barksdale.

60
00:05:34.535 --> 00:05:37.265
-Your witness.
-Thank you.

61
00:05:38.405 --> 00:05:40.168
Just one question, Mr. Gant.

62
00:05:40.808 --> 00:05:44.141
Have you ever seen this young man
before the day in question?

63
00:05:46.947 --> 00:05:51.008
-No.
-No further questions, your honor.

64
00:05:53.254 --> 00:05:56.951
You're excused, Mr. Gant.
Call your next witness.

65
00:05:57.591 --> 00:06:00.151
State calls Nakeisha Lyles, Your Honor.

66
00:06:13.874 --> 00:06:16.172
Do you promise to tell
the truth, the whole truth...

67
00:06:16.277 --> 00:06:18.211
and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

68
00:06:18.312 --> 00:06:19.472
I do.

69
00:06:22.683 --> 00:06:26.449
-Ma'am, can you state your name, please?
-Nakeisha Lyles.

70
00:06:26.787 --> 00:06:29.688
-And are you employed?
-Yes, I am.

71
00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:33.157
-And what is your occupation, Ms. Lyles?
-I'm a security guard.

72
00:06:33.794 --> 00:06:38.458
And were you employed as a security guard
on May 4, the day of the shooting?

73
00:06:38.966 --> 00:06:42.367
-What were your duties on that date?
-I was in the booth of 221 .

74
00:06:44.038 --> 00:06:48.532
And is that the guard booth in the lobby
of the Fremont Avenue high-rise?

75
00:06:48.642 --> 00:06:49.666
Yes.

76
00:06:49.843 --> 00:06:53.711
And you're behind bullet-proof glass,
with a clear view of the lobby?

77
00:06:53.881 --> 00:06:55.746
-Yeah.
-Good.

78
00:06:56.850 --> 00:06:59.318
Now, Ms. Lyles, I know
this may be difficult for you...

79
00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:01.149
but can you tell us what you saw?

80
00:07:01.555 --> 00:07:04.547
A man, you know,
he was waiting for the elevator...

81
00:07:05.025 --> 00:07:07.619
and when another man
just starts beating on him...

82
00:07:07.728 --> 00:07:10.561
and like, the one man,
he got knocked down--

83
00:07:10.664 --> 00:07:13.929
-The victim got knocked down?
-No, the man with the gun.

84
00:07:14.501 --> 00:07:16.696
The man who was knocked down had a gun.

85
00:07:17.738 --> 00:07:21.174
And do you see that man
in the courtroom today?

86
00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:27.972
Nope.

87
00:07:30.784 --> 00:07:32.046
Excuse me?

88
00:07:34.822 --> 00:07:36.312
He ain't here.

89
00:07:39.426 --> 00:07:40.757
You don't....

90
00:07:42.262 --> 00:07:43.695
You testified.

91
00:07:46.066 --> 00:07:48.364
Ms. Lyles, do you remember
when Detective Barlow...

92
00:07:48.469 --> 00:07:50.403
showed you this photo array?

93
00:07:50.504 --> 00:07:52.301
-Yeah.
-Good.

94
00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:56.039
I call your attention to your initials
which identify this photo...

95
00:07:56.643 --> 00:07:59.373
as the man who shot Mr. Blanchard.

96
00:08:00.481 --> 00:08:02.972
Did you write your initials
above that photograph?

97
00:08:06.854 --> 00:08:09.084
He ain't the one that did the shooting.

98
00:08:09.423 --> 00:08:11.254
But you identified him.

99
00:08:11.358 --> 00:08:13.952
That's 'cause
he looked like the boy that did it.

100
00:08:14.061 --> 00:08:17.929
See, the one that did it,
I saw him come in the building a week later.

101
00:08:19.133 --> 00:08:22.432
You saw someone else
you thought did the shooting?

102
00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:25.737
Right, a week later.

103
00:08:26.473 --> 00:08:28.873
Ms. Lyles, when you spoke
with the detectives...

104
00:08:28.976 --> 00:08:30.273
you never said anything about--

105
00:08:30.377 --> 00:08:33.039
I tried. I called Detective....

106
00:08:36.617 --> 00:08:41.554
Yeah, Detective Barlow on May 13th at 2:00.

107
00:08:43.357 --> 00:08:45.848
-But he didn't call me back.
-Nicely done.

108
00:08:46.093 --> 00:08:49.119
-You called Detective Barlow?
-Yeah, twice.

109
00:08:50.597 --> 00:08:53.065
Yeah, I wrote it down in the log.

110
00:08:53.667 --> 00:08:57.194
-I need a price for pressure-treated.
-$14.

111
00:08:57.471 --> 00:09:00.440
That's the price that
you were going to quote me?

112
00:09:00.541 --> 00:09:02.372
Do you feel that, Mikey, do you feel it?

113
00:09:02.476 --> 00:09:05.138
'Cause I swear to God
that is my fucking dick in your ear.

114
00:09:05.245 --> 00:09:07.475
-That's nice.
-Hang on, you fucking thief.

115
00:09:07.915 --> 00:09:09.007
What's up?

116
00:09:09.116 --> 00:09:11.084
-You been down the hall lately?
-What?

117
00:09:11.452 --> 00:09:14.580
Your case just hit the wall.
Barksdale's crew, they turned it.

118
00:09:14.855 --> 00:09:17.619
Two eyewitnesses and a statement.
No fucking way, pal.

119
00:09:19.259 --> 00:09:22.888
You listen to me, you little shit,
there is no way in hell I am paying that.

120
00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:24.492
No.

121
00:09:24.598 --> 00:09:27.294
You use my goddamn car
to chauffeur that dusty bitch around.

122
00:09:27.401 --> 00:09:29.369
-Yo, ease up.
-You don't understand.

123
00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:33.304
-I did it for that man and he do this.
-Getting heated ain't gonna help.

124
00:09:33.407 --> 00:09:37.639
-Greggs, what's your bird saying?
-It ain't what she says.

125
00:09:37.845 --> 00:09:39.870
Yeah? What do you say?

126
00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:42.540
I say we wait, shithead.

127
00:09:45.018 --> 00:09:47.452
-That's him.
-All right, easy, girl.

128
00:09:48.255 --> 00:09:50.485
-Yo, Herc, you got that?
-Yeah, we see.

129
00:09:50.591 --> 00:09:52.855
-Are the uniforms on the horn?
-They're on hold.

130
00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:55.190
-That's Ghost.
-All right, good, Tiff.

131
00:09:55.829 --> 00:09:57.456
Now tell me what I'm seeing, girl.

132
00:09:57.564 --> 00:09:59.862
-He gonna get little Mike.
-Then what?

133
00:10:00.133 --> 00:10:01.998
Mike come back with the money.

134
00:10:04.171 --> 00:10:07.106
Wait on the drop,
take the car when it's deep in the block.

135
00:10:07.207 --> 00:10:10.335
-I don't want no foot chase.
-Copy.

136
00:10:12.813 --> 00:10:13.837
Got it.

137
00:10:15.849 --> 00:10:18.374
Go, go, go. The driver's mine.

138
00:10:20.287 --> 00:10:21.914
Get the house on the left.

139
00:10:22.022 --> 00:10:23.751
Get down. Get on the ground.

140
00:10:24.258 --> 00:10:25.225
Get up.

141
00:10:25.359 --> 00:10:28.419
-Put your hands behind your head.
-Get your hands up.

142
00:10:28.529 --> 00:10:31.293
Shut the engine.
Get that motherfucker around the corner.

143
00:10:31.398 --> 00:10:34.162
Hand the keys out.
Drop the keys out of the car.

144
00:10:34.268 --> 00:10:37.396
Drop them now. Get out of the car.

145
00:10:38.705 --> 00:10:40.730
Get down right here, right here.

146
00:10:42.676 --> 00:10:45.042
Passenger, put your hands
out of the car window.

147
00:10:45.145 --> 00:10:48.808
Both hands out of the car window.
Use your right hand, open up the car door.

148
00:10:48.982 --> 00:10:51.007
Slowly. Step out of the car.

149
00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:55.853
Down on the ground.

150
00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:02.092
That's it, take his ass to jail.

151
00:11:02.362 --> 00:11:04.296
-You got him, Carv?
-I got him.

152
00:11:06.667 --> 00:11:09.158
-Look at this shit.
-Cross your legs.

153
00:11:13.006 --> 00:11:14.803
Look at this.

154
00:11:14.975 --> 00:11:17.535
You see what he did?
Do you see what he did?

155
00:11:17.678 --> 00:11:20.943
Why he throw the gun on my car?
Shit gonna scratch the paint.

156
00:11:21.048 --> 00:11:23.676
-Stay in the car.
-Tell him to leave my car be.

157
00:11:24.217 --> 00:11:26.845
-Stay in the fucking car.
-That shit just ain't right.

158
00:11:26.954 --> 00:11:29.149
Whatcha doing with something like that?

159
00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:31.721
What you got here?

160
00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:36.327
You should've seen
the way this bitch was looking at me, Kima.

161
00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:39.297
Ugly little fucker almost shit his pants
he was so scared.

162
00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:40.894
Right?

163
00:11:52.412 --> 00:11:54.346
Two guns, remember?

164
00:11:55.916 --> 00:11:58.350
-Two?
-It's all good, Kima, ease up.

165
00:12:07.394 --> 00:12:08.952
All rise.

166
00:12:09.129 --> 00:12:13.691
Part 1 2 of the Circuit Court
of Baltimore City is now in session.

167
00:12:13.867 --> 00:12:15.129
Be seated.

168
00:12:16.637 --> 00:12:19.936
Madame Forelady,
you have a unanimous verdict?

169
00:12:21.341 --> 00:12:23.809
As to the defendant D'Angelo Barksdale...

170
00:12:23.977 --> 00:12:27.003
how say you to the charge of murder
in the first degree?

171
00:12:27.614 --> 00:12:29.013
Not guilty.

172
00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:33.684
How say you to the charge of murder
in the second degree?

173
00:12:34.287 --> 00:12:35.276
Not guilty.

174
00:12:35.389 --> 00:12:36.651
Yeah.

175
00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:39.690
-That's what I'm talking about.
-Be seated.

176
00:12:39.793 --> 00:12:42.591
It's you, daddy, yeah, that's right.

177
00:12:43.096 --> 00:12:46.224
-At least you made them work for it.
-Be seated.

178
00:12:47.034 --> 00:12:50.401
The jury is to be thanked
for its services in this case.

179
00:12:50.937 --> 00:12:54.270
Deputies will return
defendant Barksdale to pre-trial...

180
00:12:54.374 --> 00:12:56.774
for processing prior to his release.

181
00:13:04.418 --> 00:13:08.445
Think I give a fuck?
I'll be chalking you off one night.

182
00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:12.982
-You have a nice day.
-Yo, Stringer, let's go.

183
00:13:21.234 --> 00:13:22.895
Detective?

184
00:13:25.806 --> 00:13:28.832
Detective. Judge asked to speak with you.

185
00:13:34.347 --> 00:13:36.508
-What the hell happened out there?
-We lost.

186
00:13:36.817 --> 00:13:38.079
Were you on this?

187
00:13:38.185 --> 00:13:39.777
-The case?
-Yeah.

188
00:13:40.253 --> 00:13:42.687
No, it was Barlow,
with an assist from McLarney.

189
00:13:42.789 --> 00:13:45.189
If it was Barlow's case,
why are you in court?

190
00:13:45.492 --> 00:13:46.618
No reason.

191
00:13:46.727 --> 00:13:49.525
You just like coming to court
on murders you don't even work?

192
00:13:49.629 --> 00:13:51.153
Just for the thrill of it?

193
00:13:53.066 --> 00:13:55.227
When you start coming with the customers...

194
00:13:55.335 --> 00:13:57.098
it's time to get out of the business.

195
00:13:57.204 --> 00:13:59.536
You shouldn't talk dirty
now that you're a judge.

196
00:13:59.639 --> 00:14:02.870
Now that I'm a judge,
I can say anything I damn please.

197
00:14:03.043 --> 00:14:06.240
That Barksdale kid,
he's a cousin to Avon Barksdale.

198
00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:10.772
-Who?
-Avon Barksdale, Stringer Bell.

199
00:14:11.251 --> 00:14:14.084
The crew that's been running
Franklin Terrace for a year.

200
00:14:14.187 --> 00:14:15.176
Stringer Bell?

201
00:14:15.288 --> 00:14:17.950
That was him in court
with the legal pad and the glasses...

202
00:14:18.058 --> 00:14:20.049
scaring the living shit out of every witness.

203
00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:23.061
Him and the rest of his crew,
Wee-Bey, Savino, Stinkum.

204
00:14:23.163 --> 00:14:26.189
-I saw them.
-You think about clearing the court?

205
00:14:26.366 --> 00:14:29.665
On what basis?
It's an open court in a free nation of laws.

206
00:14:30.070 --> 00:14:32.004
I thought it was Baltimore.

207
00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:36.941
Barksdale has five out of seven towers
in the Terrace.

208
00:14:37.043 --> 00:14:41.241
That's 10 stairwells in five high-rises,
going 24l7 for dope and coke.

209
00:14:41.448 --> 00:14:42.745
And that's just the towers.

210
00:14:42.849 --> 00:14:45.682
The low-rises,
the avenue corners, they're all his, too.

211
00:14:45.786 --> 00:14:47.549
How do you know this?

212
00:14:48.221 --> 00:14:50.121
-Everybody knows it.
-Define "everybody".

213
00:14:50.223 --> 00:14:51.815
Everybody on the Westside.

214
00:14:55.061 --> 00:14:57.256
Barksdale and Bell, they're the new power.

215
00:14:57.364 --> 00:14:59.992
I mean, they've dropped
10 or 1 2 bodies in as many months.

216
00:15:00.133 --> 00:15:03.227
Beat three cases in court
doing the same thing they just did.

217
00:15:03.336 --> 00:15:05.770
-Who's working on them?
-In the department?

218
00:15:07.641 --> 00:15:09.074
Nobody, really.

219
00:15:10.577 --> 00:15:13.045
We're a little busy
doing street rips, you know.

220
00:15:13.213 --> 00:15:15.272
Community policing and all that.

221
00:15:15.382 --> 00:15:18.545
So, if it's not your case, why do you care?

222
00:15:20.353 --> 00:15:21.911
Who said I did?

223
00:15:28.995 --> 00:15:30.121
One more time.

224
00:15:33.133 --> 00:15:34.532
Stop playing....

225
00:15:36.603 --> 00:15:38.161
Fuck me.

226
00:15:42.275 --> 00:15:44.072
You got submission numbers for the ECU?

227
00:15:44.177 --> 00:15:45.735
-Nope.
-Get them.

228
00:15:46.479 --> 00:15:49.539
-Why me?
-You want the collar, do the submissions.

229
00:15:50.116 --> 00:15:52.607
-You giving me the start?
-It's your turn.

230
00:15:53.353 --> 00:15:55.218
What's the extension for ECU?

231
00:15:56.089 --> 00:15:57.613
Do I look like your bitch?

232
00:15:58.225 --> 00:16:01.353
-We taking the Mercedes?
-No, I promised my girl.

233
00:16:01.962 --> 00:16:03.452
Car's in her name.

234
00:16:04.197 --> 00:16:05.129
Narcotics.

235
00:16:05.599 --> 00:16:08.796
-Lieutenant. Line 2.
-Here you go.

236
00:16:09.069 --> 00:16:12.095
-Fuck me, I cannot type.
-Who the fuck can?

237
00:16:12.372 --> 00:16:13.737
Millennium been and gone...

238
00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:15.899
and we still fucking around
with Smith-Corona.

239
00:16:16.009 --> 00:16:17.704
We need to get them computers hooked up.

240
00:16:17.811 --> 00:16:19.676
They promised to train us a year ago.

241
00:16:19.779 --> 00:16:22.907
What would an ass-ignorant motherfucker
like you do with a computer?

242
00:16:23.016 --> 00:16:26.918
-I don't know, trade stocks and shit.
-Jerk off, you mean.

243
00:16:27.053 --> 00:16:30.989
We get them computers hooked up,
Herc'll be deep into some porn...

244
00:16:31.091 --> 00:16:34.185
and Kima'll still be bangin' out
her 24s on that old piece of shit.

245
00:16:34.294 --> 00:16:36.285
-Gotta go upstairs.
-What's up?

246
00:16:36.630 --> 00:16:38.598
Deputy's throwing some kinda piss-fit.

247
00:16:38.832 --> 00:16:41.630
-Major know?
-He's up there now.

248
00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:45.604
With a mouthful of piss, probably.

249
00:16:45.872 --> 00:16:48.136
Like our major don't know
what that tastes like?

250
00:16:48.241 --> 00:16:51.369
It's the chain-of-command, baby,
the shit always rolls downhill.

251
00:16:51.745 --> 00:16:55.511
-Motherfucker, we talking about piss.
-Piss does too, think about it.

252
00:16:55.615 --> 00:16:59.278
-Shit rolls, piss trickles.
-Downhill, though.

253
00:16:59.386 --> 00:17:00.614
You don't know that for sure--

254
00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:03.188
Not to change the subject
on you two charmers...

255
00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:05.524
but why are there only two ECU numbers?

256
00:17:05.625 --> 00:17:08.617
-Dope and guns.
-Two guns, right?

257
00:17:09.763 --> 00:17:12.095
-That's three.
-Fuck it, Kima.

258
00:17:12.198 --> 00:17:15.099
You want a job done right,
you gotta do it your own self.

259
00:17:18.305 --> 00:17:20.671
He means
that we are an effective deterrent...

260
00:17:20.807 --> 00:17:22.832
on the war on drugs
when we are on the street.

261
00:17:22.943 --> 00:17:25.537
-Fucking motherfuckers up, right?
-Indeed.

262
00:17:25.645 --> 00:17:27.044
Fuck the paperwork.

263
00:17:27.147 --> 00:17:29.809
-Collect bodies, split heads.
-Split them wide.

264
00:17:29.983 --> 00:17:32.247
-The Western District way.
-All right.

265
00:17:32.552 --> 00:17:34.816
You heroic motherfuckers kill me.

266
00:17:35.755 --> 00:17:37.552
Fighting the war on drugs...

267
00:17:37.791 --> 00:17:40.021
one brutality case at a time.

268
00:17:40.994 --> 00:17:42.985
Girl, you can't even call this shit a war.

269
00:17:43.163 --> 00:17:44.357
Why not?

270
00:17:45.131 --> 00:17:46.325
Wars end.

271
00:17:51.037 --> 00:17:52.368
You gonna write that down?

272
00:17:59.012 --> 00:18:02.277
How happy am I to see my pager go off
with your call number?

273
00:18:02.449 --> 00:18:03.780
Smoke 'em if you got 'em...

274
00:18:03.883 --> 00:18:06.078
because this motherfucker
is as ripe as they get.

275
00:18:06.186 --> 00:18:09.383
-We aren't up, Nolan's squad is up.
-I know.

276
00:18:09.489 --> 00:18:11.354
But you had to answer the fucking phone.

277
00:18:11.458 --> 00:18:14.325
-Got to pay down my credit cards.
-Not off him, you ain't.

278
00:18:14.627 --> 00:18:16.993
I leave you alone for a minute,
what do you do?

279
00:18:17.097 --> 00:18:19.998
-All right, I heard you.
-Say the words, Bunk.

280
00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:22.491
-Come on, man.
-Speak to me.

281
00:18:23.069 --> 00:18:26.698
So, you gonna cut and run on the Bunk?
That shit ain't right, Jimmy.

282
00:18:27.874 --> 00:18:30.502
All right, then, this is my case. My file.

283
00:18:30.910 --> 00:18:32.241
This shit comes back a murder...

284
00:18:32.345 --> 00:18:35.041
you ain't gotta do shit
but stand there and laugh at me.

285
00:18:35.148 --> 00:18:36.410
You happy now, you bitch?

286
00:18:36.516 --> 00:18:39.849
This'll teach you to give a fuck
when it ain't your turn.

287
00:18:39.953 --> 00:18:41.853
It ain't even gonna be a murder.

288
00:18:41.955 --> 00:18:45.686
This motherfucker probably came in here
to take a shit and just fell out.

289
00:18:45.792 --> 00:18:47.259
I bet there ain't nothing to it.

290
00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:49.123
-You hope.
-Where you going?

291
00:18:50.597 --> 00:18:53.191
Back to the office, where I belong.

292
00:18:57.203 --> 00:18:59.865
You moldering motherfucker.

293
00:18:59.973 --> 00:19:02.100
Don't even think
about coming back a murder.

294
00:19:02.208 --> 00:19:03.971
Don't even think of that shit.

295
00:19:08.048 --> 00:19:11.074
By tomorrow, Lieutenant. Don't fail me.

296
00:19:19.292 --> 00:19:21.760
-Major's pissed.
-He should be.

297
00:19:22.328 --> 00:19:24.660
He didn't have answers
for the deputy's questions.

298
00:19:24.764 --> 00:19:27.699
-About what?
-Avon Barksdale.

299
00:19:28.234 --> 00:19:29.758
Who?

300
00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:34.201
-That's what I said.
-Who the fuck is Avon Barksdale?

301
00:19:34.908 --> 00:19:37.001
According to the right honorable
Judge Phelan...

302
00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:40.602
a Westside player who apparently indulges
in the occasional murder.

303
00:19:41.915 --> 00:19:44.440
Now, as of today,
I never heard of Mr. Barksdale...

304
00:19:44.717 --> 00:19:46.878
but by tomorrow....

305
00:19:49.089 --> 00:19:51.216
All right, what do we know?

306
00:19:51.324 --> 00:19:54.088
According to the judge,
he has the Westside high-rises.

307
00:19:54.194 --> 00:19:55.456
The Terrace, mostly.

308
00:19:56.362 --> 00:19:59.559
-Sounds like a bunch of bullshit to me.
-Maybe so.

309
00:20:02.936 --> 00:20:05.871
-It's gotta be tonight?
-Major wants it filed by morning.

310
00:20:10.743 --> 00:20:12.045
Call Andrews at DEA.
See what they have on this mope.

311
00:20:12.045 --> 00:20:14.138
Call Andrews at DEA.
See what they have on this mope.

312
00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:16.578
What about Homicide?
lf the guy's doing murders--

313
00:20:16.683 --> 00:20:18.378
Homicide major was in the same meeting.

314
00:20:18.485 --> 00:20:21.477
His people will be scrambling
to get something on paper, too.

315
00:20:21.754 --> 00:20:24.621
I doubt they'll be willing to share,
but you can try.

316
00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:30.296
Barksdale, Avon.

317
00:20:31.397 --> 00:20:32.694
Got a DOB?

318
00:20:46.146 --> 00:20:49.206
-Jay.
-Where the fuck you been all day?

319
00:20:49.449 --> 00:20:53.385
Drinking, crack smoking.
Whoring myself on the streets of Baltimore.

320
00:20:53.486 --> 00:20:56.387
Okay. Just so you have an excuse.

321
00:20:56.689 --> 00:20:59.624
But your fuck of a partner
picked up the phone, caught a call.

322
00:20:59.726 --> 00:21:02.490
-Yeah, I saw him out there.
-Yeah, what'd he get?

323
00:21:03.129 --> 00:21:06.326
-Decomp in a vacant apartment.
-Fuck.

324
00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.195
Nolan's squad was up,
that one should be theirs.

325
00:21:09.302 --> 00:21:11.634
It's a decomp.
Maybe it comes back a natural death.

326
00:21:11.738 --> 00:21:14.764
-You think?
-In the Poe Homes, no fucking way.

327
00:21:14.874 --> 00:21:15.841
Hold up.

328
00:21:15.942 --> 00:21:18.001
Major wants to talk to you
before you roll out.

329
00:21:18.111 --> 00:21:21.308
-What about?
-Fuck should I know, I'm only your sergeant.

330
00:21:30.056 --> 00:21:32.115
Sit the fuck down, Detective.

331
00:21:33.159 --> 00:21:34.592
Something wrong?

332
00:21:36.629 --> 00:21:38.221
Put your ass in the chair.

333
00:21:51.144 --> 00:21:54.739
You see these, McNulty, you see them?
These are for you.

334
00:21:55.281 --> 00:21:58.079
These are for you
for as long as it takes me to get even.

335
00:21:59.385 --> 00:22:00.317
Major, what--

336
00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:05.153
Don't "Major" me,
you backstabbing, smartass piece of shit.

337
00:22:05.925 --> 00:22:08.450
What the fuck you doing
over at the courthouse anyway?

338
00:22:08.561 --> 00:22:11.155
Why the fuck are you talking
to some shitbag judge?

339
00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:16.430
These are for you, McNulty.

340
00:22:16.536 --> 00:22:19.937
This one over here
is going up your narrow fucking lrish ass.

341
00:22:20.039 --> 00:22:22.599
And this bad boy over here
is in your fucking eye.

342
00:22:22.709 --> 00:22:26.406
I'm upstairs answering questions
about some project nigger I never heard of...

343
00:22:26.512 --> 00:22:28.878
who's supposedly beat
my unit out of 10 murders.

344
00:22:28.982 --> 00:22:31.507
Three. They only beat three in court.

345
00:22:31.618 --> 00:22:33.449
I got the deputy asking about 10.

346
00:22:33.553 --> 00:22:36.681
No, they did 10,
we only charged them with three.

347
00:22:37.390 --> 00:22:40.553
-You're full of shit.
-Sir, you can check the files.

348
00:22:40.994 --> 00:22:44.521
Maurice Scroggins,
Toreen Boyd, Roland Leggett.

349
00:22:44.697 --> 00:22:47.393
The girl they found
in the stairwell in Saratoga...

350
00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:48.967
Collette something or other.

351
00:22:49.502 --> 00:22:51.094
I mean, Major, these guys are real.

352
00:22:51.204 --> 00:22:55.436
They beat me up on the Gerard Bogue case
just like they did Barlow.

353
00:22:56.342 --> 00:23:00.073
Scroggins? I don't have an H-file
on Scroggins.

354
00:23:00.213 --> 00:23:01.510
He was last year, summer.

355
00:23:01.614 --> 00:23:04.208
Two in the back of the head,
low-rise courtyard.

356
00:23:05.785 --> 00:23:08.117
Let me understand something.

357
00:23:08.221 --> 00:23:12.385
You are having the deputy
bust my balls over a prior-year case?

358
00:23:13.192 --> 00:23:16.650
Is this what I need from you,
you insubordinate little fuck?

359
00:23:17.730 --> 00:23:19.288
Major, look, I'm really sorry.

360
00:23:20.166 --> 00:23:22.498
Phelan, he and l,
we go back a little, you know?

361
00:23:22.602 --> 00:23:25.833
He wanted to know what I know
about the crew in his court.

362
00:23:25.938 --> 00:23:27.735
I had to go upstairs knowing nothing...

363
00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:30.934
and explain to the deputy why
he's getting calls about murders...

364
00:23:31.044 --> 00:23:32.534
that don't mean a shit to anybody.

365
00:23:32.645 --> 00:23:35.637
Look, sir, this judge, he fucks me up.

366
00:23:36.883 --> 00:23:38.646
He asks me a question and I answer it.

367
00:23:38.751 --> 00:23:41.015
I didn't know he was gonna call anybody.

368
00:23:45.525 --> 00:23:47.823
You have my attention, Detective.

369
00:23:48.461 --> 00:23:50.395
My complete, undivided attention.

370
00:23:55.201 --> 00:23:57.260
-Yes, sir.
-Where you going?

371
00:23:58.571 --> 00:24:00.539
-I'm 8:00-to-4:00.
-No.

372
00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:03.099
-You're typing.
-Sir?

373
00:24:04.744 --> 00:24:07.304
Deputy wants a report
on his desk at 0800.

374
00:24:07.413 --> 00:24:10.974
-A report?
-Clean, no typos.

375
00:24:11.551 --> 00:24:13.883
Make it look right, then put my name on it.

376
00:24:14.821 --> 00:24:18.484
Do you want to reference all the murders?
Or should I soft-pedal that?

377
00:24:18.591 --> 00:24:20.821
Fucking horse is out the barn door, right?

378
00:24:20.993 --> 00:24:23.655
Let's try not to make me look stupid twice.

379
00:24:24.530 --> 00:24:28.330
And when you list the cases,
put a little dot next to each one.

380
00:24:28.935 --> 00:24:32.029
-Deputy likes dots.
-I'm sorry, Major, really.

381
00:24:45.651 --> 00:24:47.516
Niggers crazy in there, yo.

382
00:24:47.620 --> 00:24:49.611
Eastside, Westside, everybody beefing.

383
00:24:50.323 --> 00:24:53.884
-You ain't got no problem, right?
-Hell no, we deep in there.

384
00:24:56.362 --> 00:24:58.489
Y'all deep down at the courthouse, too.

385
00:24:59.132 --> 00:25:01.692
Sitting there, I didn't know
what the fuck would happen.

386
00:25:01.801 --> 00:25:02.790
I'm wondering...

387
00:25:02.902 --> 00:25:05.234
how y'all gonna make it
happen for me, you know?

388
00:25:05.571 --> 00:25:07.903
Slick what y'all did
with that security lady though.

389
00:25:08.007 --> 00:25:10.202
That shit was tight, yo.

390
00:25:16.649 --> 00:25:17.911
Let's walk.

391
00:25:32.098 --> 00:25:35.067
-What's the rule?
-I know the rule.

392
00:25:35.902 --> 00:25:37.335
Say it.

393
00:25:38.504 --> 00:25:40.096
Don't talk in the car.

394
00:25:42.508 --> 00:25:44.567
Or on the phone
or in any place that ain't ours.

395
00:25:44.677 --> 00:25:47.441
Don't say shit to anybody who ain't us.
But it was just you.

396
00:25:47.547 --> 00:25:49.310
It's your fucking truck.

397
00:25:51.484 --> 00:25:52.951
Don't talk in the car.

398
00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:29.082
What about Marcel?

399
00:26:31.090 --> 00:26:33.388
No, I ain't inviting Marcel.

400
00:26:33.493 --> 00:26:36.826
-You want him out?
-I really don't give a shit what you do.

401
00:26:36.929 --> 00:26:38.260
Actually, no.

402
00:26:38.664 --> 00:26:41.656
Go down there and make that motherfucker
pay for his drinks.

403
00:26:42.168 --> 00:26:43.430
The bum.

404
00:26:51.911 --> 00:26:54.311
-How you doing?
-What's up, Dee, good to see you.

405
00:26:54.413 --> 00:26:56.108
What up, man?

406
00:26:59.952 --> 00:27:03.581
Yo, you remember the cop
that tried to pin Gerard on little Kevin?

407
00:27:03.756 --> 00:27:06.953
-Which one?
-White detective, black hair.

408
00:27:07.126 --> 00:27:10.459
-The one that was knocking on all the doors.
-What about him?

409
00:27:11.697 --> 00:27:13.562
He showed up in court to watch.

410
00:27:15.001 --> 00:27:16.127
Word?

411
00:27:16.802 --> 00:27:18.963
What are you talking
to that motherfucker for?

412
00:27:19.071 --> 00:27:20.163
Damn, Dee.

413
00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:22.568
He say anything?

414
00:27:22.675 --> 00:27:24.870
No, just sat in the back.

415
00:27:33.753 --> 00:27:37.314
-Yo, what up, money?
-What you got?

416
00:27:37.957 --> 00:27:40.187
Come on, I got something for you.

417
00:27:53.539 --> 00:27:56.565
-You must feel good.
-You know how that go.

418
00:27:56.943 --> 00:28:00.344
-Say what?
-I'm saying, you know, jail ain't no joke.

419
00:28:00.446 --> 00:28:02.277
I don't know shit about jail.

420
00:28:02.381 --> 00:28:04.815
I don't plan on knowing shit
about jail, you feel me?

421
00:28:04.917 --> 00:28:08.250
You wanna talk about jail though,
you can go sit down next to Marcel.

422
00:28:08.354 --> 00:28:11.084
-He just got home.
-True, you right.

423
00:28:11.991 --> 00:28:13.185
Sit your ass down.

424
00:28:19.498 --> 00:28:20.829
I know it ain't go so good.

425
00:28:20.933 --> 00:28:23.401
But that nigger, Pooh,
he caught me off guard.

426
00:28:23.502 --> 00:28:26.699
-He came at me like he was crazy.
-So you shoot the motherfucker?

427
00:28:26.806 --> 00:28:28.569
I'm saying, it was him or me.

428
00:28:29.008 --> 00:28:30.202
You in our building.

429
00:28:30.876 --> 00:28:32.468
You got people on both stairs.

430
00:28:32.578 --> 00:28:35.103
You got more motherfucking people
out in the court.

431
00:28:37.116 --> 00:28:40.813
And you got a gun.
So, what I'm trying to figure out is...

432
00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:42.979
how the fuck you end up
shooting this nigger...

433
00:28:43.089 --> 00:28:45.523
in front of the security booth
with all them people?

434
00:28:45.625 --> 00:28:47.559
I'm saying, this nigger was coming at me...

435
00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:50.185
-Iike he was trying to end me.
-This ain't about him.

436
00:28:50.496 --> 00:28:51.963
It's about you.

437
00:28:53.065 --> 00:28:56.523
You can't play him out of that lobby.
You can't take a beating neither.

438
00:28:56.636 --> 00:29:00.003
So, the first thing you do,
you get all emotional...

439
00:29:00.373 --> 00:29:02.864
you pull your gun out,
you do some dumb shit...

440
00:29:03.142 --> 00:29:05.269
that now we got to work around.

441
00:29:05.811 --> 00:29:06.800
I know.

442
00:29:10.850 --> 00:29:14.251
You ain't said
one motherfucking thing I want to hear.

443
00:29:16.155 --> 00:29:20.023
You right.
I mean, I gotta start thinking more.

444
00:29:20.126 --> 00:29:22.356
You be saying that
all the time and you right.

445
00:29:23.596 --> 00:29:25.496
But I'm saying though, I mean...

446
00:29:25.698 --> 00:29:28.394
the shit y'all pulled with that security lady.

447
00:29:28.601 --> 00:29:32.367
It was tight. I mean, that state lawyer.

448
00:29:32.872 --> 00:29:35.898
I ain't never seen
a white woman turn so red.

449
00:29:36.108 --> 00:29:38.167
You should've been there.

450
00:29:39.345 --> 00:29:41.438
Yo, man, you family, okay?

451
00:29:42.314 --> 00:29:46.546
But that shit cost money.
It cost time and money.

452
00:29:47.687 --> 00:29:49.052
You gonna make that right?

453
00:29:49.789 --> 00:29:51.916
Most def, you gonna see.

454
00:29:52.024 --> 00:29:54.959
When I get back to the tower,
I'm gonna push them niggers.

455
00:30:00.466 --> 00:30:01.626
All right.

456
00:30:05.237 --> 00:30:06.431
Come here.

457
00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:09.635
Don't walk out of here like that.

458
00:30:09.775 --> 00:30:11.538
-You family, all right?
-All right.

459
00:30:11.677 --> 00:30:14.009
-You know it's always love.
-Yeah.

460
00:30:32.832 --> 00:30:34.129
Type quieter.

461
00:30:35.801 --> 00:30:37.666
You didn't have to wait up, love.

462
00:30:38.270 --> 00:30:39.862
Your boy have a heart attack?

463
00:30:39.972 --> 00:30:42.270
No, I went that way...

464
00:30:42.374 --> 00:30:44.569
but Doc Frazier didn't bite
when this popped up.

465
00:30:44.677 --> 00:30:48.807
-You seriously fucked.
-Speaking of fucked, why are you here?

466
00:30:49.515 --> 00:30:52.211
I did bad, Bunk. It wasn't my fault.

467
00:30:52.918 --> 00:30:54.317
Really.

468
00:30:54.420 --> 00:30:57.651
Judge Phelan pulled me up
when the jury let the Barksdale kid go.

469
00:30:57.757 --> 00:31:00.783
Him being a judge and all,
I let go of some shit.

470
00:31:01.794 --> 00:31:03.125
He raise a stink?

471
00:31:03.963 --> 00:31:07.729
Major got busted by the Deputy Ops
and I gotta have a report by morning.

472
00:31:08.234 --> 00:31:12.330
There you go, giving a fuck
when it ain't your turn to give a fuck.

473
00:31:22.248 --> 00:31:23.977
Look at them, Cole.

474
00:31:24.617 --> 00:31:27.609
Don't it make your dick bust concrete
to be in the same room...

475
00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:30.416
with two noble, selfless public servants?

476
00:31:30.523 --> 00:31:31.888
I know I'm proud.

477
00:31:33.959 --> 00:31:35.722
Tell me you put this one down.

478
00:31:36.862 --> 00:31:38.159
Of course not.

479
00:31:38.264 --> 00:31:41.358
Of course your partner here
has to go over to the courthouse...

480
00:31:41.467 --> 00:31:43.765
and lay our business out in front of a judge.

481
00:31:43.869 --> 00:31:45.131
So, you heard?

482
00:31:45.237 --> 00:31:47.705
Major calls me at home,
says I should get in early...

483
00:31:47.807 --> 00:31:49.741
read over your shoulder.

484
00:31:52.444 --> 00:31:53.911
It's got dots.

485
00:31:54.346 --> 00:31:55.813
Deputy loves dots.

486
00:31:56.115 --> 00:31:57.639
Fuck you and your dots.

487
00:31:58.184 --> 00:32:01.449
All I did was answer the guy's questions.
He's a fucking judge.

488
00:32:02.521 --> 00:32:04.853
And the Deputy's the fucking Deputy.

489
00:32:04.957 --> 00:32:06.254
And he, not the judge...

490
00:32:06.358 --> 00:32:09.452
has what's left of your beshitted career
in his hot little hands.

491
00:32:09.562 --> 00:32:10.688
He says so...

492
00:32:10.796 --> 00:32:13.629
you're walking foot
in the Western tomorrow.

493
00:32:13.732 --> 00:32:18.101
-Fuck it, I came from Western.
-Where don't you want to go, asshole?

494
00:32:18.204 --> 00:32:20.866
Evidence Control? Personnel?

495
00:32:22.208 --> 00:32:25.302
-Headquarter Security?
-The boat.

496
00:32:25.744 --> 00:32:27.041
The marine unit?

497
00:32:27.646 --> 00:32:30.274
Yeah, those diesel fumes,
they make me feel seasick.

498
00:32:30.950 --> 00:32:32.383
That's good, keep it up.

499
00:32:33.118 --> 00:32:37.111
I'll go this against $10,
you're riding the boat, midnight shift.

500
00:32:40.125 --> 00:32:42.059
Listen to the man, Jimmy.

501
00:32:57.543 --> 00:32:59.272
Yo, Stringer.

502
00:33:00.980 --> 00:33:04.211
-You here early.
-Yeah, I'm on my game today.

503
00:33:04.750 --> 00:33:06.149
Eggy put out testers?

504
00:33:10.155 --> 00:33:11.679
New deal today.

505
00:33:13.092 --> 00:33:15.652
You going out on point,
picking up business in the Pit.

506
00:33:15.761 --> 00:33:18.559
-What?
-You the man in the low-rises.

507
00:33:19.598 --> 00:33:22.089
The low-rises?
You got Ronnie Mo in the Pit.

508
00:33:22.201 --> 00:33:24.829
Ronnie Mo got 851 this morning.

509
00:33:26.405 --> 00:33:29.670
Why you gonna put me in the low-rises
when I had a tower since summer?

510
00:33:29.775 --> 00:33:31.333
Yeah, you had a tower.

511
00:33:32.912 --> 00:33:36.643
And you might have a tower again
if you can keep your mind to shit.

512
00:33:37.149 --> 00:33:38.548
This is fucked up.

513
00:33:38.751 --> 00:33:43.017
You show us you can run the Pit,
and you'll be back uptown soon enough.

514
00:33:44.657 --> 00:33:46.090
My uncle know about this?

515
00:33:49.228 --> 00:33:50.627
What do you think?

516
00:33:52.831 --> 00:33:54.856
-Yo, Bey.
-Yo.

517
00:33:55.734 --> 00:33:58.168
Give little cousin here a ride down the way.

518
00:34:15.587 --> 00:34:18.715
-Have your people deal with Daniels.
-Right.

519
00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:36.703
You gonna send your man McNulty?

520
00:34:37.943 --> 00:34:39.638
Tell him about chain-of-command.

521
00:34:39.745 --> 00:34:42.145
Tell him yourself, he's dead to me.

522
00:35:16.048 --> 00:35:19.575
-Yo, you looking for Ronnie Mo, he uptown.
-I know.

523
00:35:22.488 --> 00:35:23.682
You Dee, right?

524
00:35:26.191 --> 00:35:29.092
-Wasn't you in the towers?
-Yeah.

525
00:35:30.062 --> 00:35:33.623
Why they put you down here, yo?
You mess with the count or something?

526
00:35:34.533 --> 00:35:35.761
I killed a nigger.

527
00:35:43.142 --> 00:35:45.269
Last call on green top, last call.

528
00:35:49.281 --> 00:35:50.270
Major?

529
00:35:50.649 --> 00:35:53.914
Counting what we got from the DEA,
how much do we have on this guy?

530
00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:57.388
Lieutenant, in my hand,
I'm holding how many pages?

531
00:35:57.489 --> 00:35:59.753
-Four, sir.
-Rawls had a fucking phone book.

532
00:35:59.858 --> 00:36:02.088
What can I tell you,
they got 10 open murder files.

533
00:36:02.194 --> 00:36:05.027
If we had 10 shots at him,
we'd have more than a fat file.

534
00:36:05.130 --> 00:36:06.119
I said that upstairs.

535
00:36:06.231 --> 00:36:08.358
They can't put this guy down for a murder...

536
00:36:08.467 --> 00:36:12.198
-so they're getting us to do their work.
-Not getting us, they got us.

537
00:36:12.304 --> 00:36:13.828
They got you, in fact.

538
00:36:14.039 --> 00:36:15.097
Excuse me, sir?

539
00:36:15.207 --> 00:36:17.675
Dawson has the York and Cator case,
that leaves you.

540
00:36:18.610 --> 00:36:21.511
Shit. Look, set something up
with Homicide...

541
00:36:21.613 --> 00:36:23.513
and whoever else
you want from your squads.

542
00:36:23.615 --> 00:36:26.345
-State's Attorney?
-Yeah, we should call them, too.

543
00:36:29.021 --> 00:36:30.386
Fucking shitstorm.

544
00:36:32.925 --> 00:36:34.620
Lieutenant, line 3.

545
00:36:36.161 --> 00:36:37.287
Deputy Ops.

546
00:36:46.472 --> 00:36:47.962
Here we go.

547
00:36:49.475 --> 00:36:51.102
Close that for me.

548
00:36:53.946 --> 00:36:55.504
What's the coffee do?

549
00:36:55.814 --> 00:36:59.011
Give it that money feel,
so it don't seem so white.

550
00:36:59.118 --> 00:37:00.107
Yeah.

551
00:37:00.219 --> 00:37:02.483
Leastways, you got it
on both sides this time.

552
00:37:02.888 --> 00:37:04.913
All right, give me the real.

553
00:37:10.129 --> 00:37:12.256
Wait, why are we gonna use real money?

554
00:37:12.364 --> 00:37:14.855
We're not burning
no lemon street chumps here.

555
00:37:15.033 --> 00:37:16.193
Feel me?

556
00:37:18.103 --> 00:37:19.195
I'm down.

557
00:37:22.274 --> 00:37:25.607
You down? Johnny's down.

558
00:37:34.453 --> 00:37:36.785
-You got that gig.
-Can I get a one-on-one?

559
00:37:36.889 --> 00:37:38.720
Yo, Poot.

560
00:37:52.104 --> 00:37:53.765
Yo, Wallace.

561
00:37:58.510 --> 00:38:00.637
This the way Ronnie Mo set it up?

562
00:38:00.746 --> 00:38:03.044
-Yeah.
-Man, this is fucked up.

563
00:38:04.349 --> 00:38:06.783
Look, you can't serve
your customers straight up...

564
00:38:06.885 --> 00:38:08.284
after taking they money.

565
00:38:08.453 --> 00:38:11.251
Somebody snapping pictures,
they got the whole damn thing.

566
00:38:11.356 --> 00:38:13.881
See what I'm saying? You get paid...

567
00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:16.824
you send they ass off
around the building, yo.

568
00:38:16.929 --> 00:38:18.863
Then you serve. All right?

569
00:38:19.131 --> 00:38:22.259
We gotta start tightening up, man.
No more shortcuts.

570
00:38:23.602 --> 00:38:26.537
-What's your count?
-I'm up $270.

571
00:38:30.776 --> 00:38:32.073
You want to count it.

572
00:38:32.844 --> 00:38:35.438
I mean, I don't know how
you do shit up in the towers.

573
00:38:35.547 --> 00:38:38.345
-But down here, you want to count it.
-Shit.

574
00:38:44.156 --> 00:38:45.817
Y'all niggers been burnt.

575
00:38:47.693 --> 00:38:49.524
That's what you got to say?

576
00:38:50.229 --> 00:38:52.197
This look like money, motherfucker?

577
00:38:52.397 --> 00:38:56.629
Money be green. Money feel like money.

578
00:38:56.902 --> 00:39:00.338
-That shit look green to you?
-It got a dead fucking president on it.

579
00:39:00.505 --> 00:39:02.769
I don't give a fuck about the president.

580
00:39:02.874 --> 00:39:05.240
-That shit ain't money.
-He ain't no president.

581
00:39:06.178 --> 00:39:08.442
-What you mean?
-Hamilton.

582
00:39:08.547 --> 00:39:10.845
-He ain't no president.
-Nigger, is you crazy?

583
00:39:11.083 --> 00:39:13.551
Ain't no ugly-ass white man
get his face on no legal...

584
00:39:13.652 --> 00:39:15.813
motherfucking tender except he president.

585
00:39:16.321 --> 00:39:19.950
This shit happen again, you off the money.
You hear me?

586
00:39:20.459 --> 00:39:22.256
You ain't even gonna be serving no more.

587
00:39:22.361 --> 00:39:24.591
Your ass be out
on the bottom end of Vine street...

588
00:39:24.696 --> 00:39:27.130
sucking on a 40, yelling "5-0".
You hear me?

589
00:39:29.067 --> 00:39:30.591
Get the fuck out of here.

590
00:39:33.338 --> 00:39:34.396
That it?

591
00:39:36.074 --> 00:39:37.041
No.

592
00:39:58.930 --> 00:40:01.125
You need to pace that shit, man.

593
00:40:03.302 --> 00:40:06.738
-Johnny, man, you hear me?
-I'm cool.

594
00:40:07.739 --> 00:40:09.434
No, man, you gonna fall out...

595
00:40:09.541 --> 00:40:12.203
slamming that shit like that
one of these days, boy.

596
00:40:17.382 --> 00:40:20.840
Yo, man, I'm trying
to give you a little game, man...

597
00:40:20.952 --> 00:40:23.477
but you want to pretend
like you know something.

598
00:40:25.691 --> 00:40:27.124
I know a lot, Bubbs.

599
00:40:27.426 --> 00:40:29.451
No, you green.

600
00:40:30.295 --> 00:40:33.787
I'm trying to get you brown, man...

601
00:40:33.965 --> 00:40:35.455
but you still green.

602
00:40:36.768 --> 00:40:38.531
You gonna make me brown?

603
00:40:43.942 --> 00:40:45.534
Yo, Bubbs?

604
00:40:46.611 --> 00:40:48.272
Let me do the scam tomorrow.

605
00:40:50.515 --> 00:40:52.073
Come on, man, I'm ready.

606
00:40:56.321 --> 00:40:58.118
Yo, I'm brown.

607
00:41:01.526 --> 00:41:03.585
Shit, man, you ain't even fucking beige.

608
00:41:27.586 --> 00:41:29.679
-Buy-busts.
-Yes, sir.

609
00:41:29.988 --> 00:41:33.754
No long surveillances,
no Kel recorders, no DNRs.

610
00:41:34.326 --> 00:41:36.658
I want to get in and out
as quickly as possible.

611
00:41:37.295 --> 00:41:38.353
That makes sense.

612
00:41:38.463 --> 00:41:42.422
Phelan isn't just a judge,
he's a political entity.

613
00:41:43.235 --> 00:41:46.329
If he asks for something,
I want to give it to him.

614
00:41:46.438 --> 00:41:48.804
Why is he asking about this Barksdale?

615
00:41:50.275 --> 00:41:53.938
He watched his state's attorney
get beat up in his court this week.

616
00:41:54.045 --> 00:41:57.139
-Lost a murder case.
-We lose cases all the time.

617
00:41:57.249 --> 00:42:00.150
But a judge happens
to be asking about this one.

618
00:42:00.886 --> 00:42:03.377
-Who you using?
-Lead detective?

619
00:42:03.588 --> 00:42:06.489
-Greggs, she's my best right now.
-I know her?

620
00:42:06.958 --> 00:42:09.984
CID for four months.
Came over from Eastern DEU.

621
00:42:11.163 --> 00:42:14.621
-Who's Homicide sending?
-That's up to Major Rawls.

622
00:42:15.367 --> 00:42:17.801
I wouldn't be surprised if you get McNulty.

623
00:42:18.069 --> 00:42:20.629
-You know McNulty?
-Not really.

624
00:42:20.806 --> 00:42:23.707
He's the one who mouthed off
to the judge in the first place.

625
00:42:23.809 --> 00:42:26.869
-He talked to the judge?
-Yeah, that's my understanding.

626
00:42:27.145 --> 00:42:30.205
So, if he comes over on this,
watch your back.

627
00:42:30.382 --> 00:42:32.441
You need anything, you ask me.

628
00:42:33.051 --> 00:42:34.518
I'll give you all the help I can.

629
00:42:34.619 --> 00:42:37.110
-But no surprises.
-Yes, sir.

630
00:42:38.323 --> 00:42:39.756
Keep me briefed.

631
00:42:57.476 --> 00:43:01.071
-Hi, McNulty, City Homicide.
-Is anyone expecting you?

632
00:43:01.179 --> 00:43:03.909
Yeah, Special Agent Fitzhugh, Squad 5.

633
00:43:05.851 --> 00:43:06.977
He's expecting me, can l--

634
00:43:07.085 --> 00:43:10.248
-Not without an escort.
-All right.

635
00:43:11.423 --> 00:43:13.448
Agent Fitzhugh to the front.

636
00:43:28.206 --> 00:43:30.037
-Fitz.
-Brother.

637
00:43:30.141 --> 00:43:32.473
-She can spot a bad one.
-Nothing personal, Jimmy.

638
00:43:32.577 --> 00:43:34.477
You know how they are
with security nowadays.

639
00:43:34.579 --> 00:43:37.377
I know how they are with locals, yeah.
So, what's up, g-man?

640
00:43:37.482 --> 00:43:39.279
-Good stuff.
-Yeah?

641
00:43:39.384 --> 00:43:41.181
Your man gave us a hell of a case.

642
00:43:41.353 --> 00:43:43.378
Comes to informants, Jimmy,
you can pick 'em.

643
00:43:43.488 --> 00:43:45.513
He's one of the better Cl's I've ever worked.

644
00:43:45.624 --> 00:43:48.388
-You up on a wire?
-That and more.

645
00:43:50.662 --> 00:43:54.223
So, like, he be talking like
he got some type of record deal, you know?

646
00:43:54.432 --> 00:43:57.424
-Man, please.
-That nigger.

647
00:43:59.237 --> 00:44:02.172
-The pussy has you.
-Jesus Christ.

648
00:44:02.274 --> 00:44:05.209
-Pretty fucking great, huh?
-How'd you get this on tape?

649
00:44:05.477 --> 00:44:08.139
That's not tape. That's live, brother.

650
00:44:09.781 --> 00:44:11.112
That's live?

651
00:44:11.216 --> 00:44:14.242
Live from a three-story walkup
on Homer Avenue...

652
00:44:14.386 --> 00:44:16.081
in the bottoms of Pimlico.

653
00:44:16.187 --> 00:44:17.552
This is going on right now?

654
00:44:17.656 --> 00:44:20.124
-As we speak.
-How?

655
00:44:20.258 --> 00:44:23.523
Fiber-optic lensing.
Camera's behind a hole in the drywall.

656
00:44:23.628 --> 00:44:25.960
So small it looks like
a nail might've made it.

657
00:44:26.364 --> 00:44:28.730
Where's the mic?
These motherfuckers sound great.

658
00:44:28.833 --> 00:44:31.301
Two remotes behind
the baseboard heating ducts.

659
00:44:32.037 --> 00:44:34.369
That's about $3,000 of raw
on the table today.

660
00:44:34.472 --> 00:44:36.235
We followed it all the way from New York.

661
00:44:36.341 --> 00:44:37.740
You're up in New York on this?

662
00:44:37.842 --> 00:44:39.070
We could be.

663
00:44:39.778 --> 00:44:42.076
We're backing into
some Dominicans up there.

664
00:44:42.414 --> 00:44:44.516
We could have a Title Ill
on them right now if we wanted.

665
00:44:44.516 --> 00:44:45.210
We could have a Title Ill
on them right now if we wanted.

666
00:44:45.383 --> 00:44:47.010
Wrong war, brother.

667
00:44:47.285 --> 00:44:49.947
Most of the squad's been transferred
to counterterrorism.

668
00:44:50.055 --> 00:44:52.319
This thing's the last drug case
we got pending...

669
00:44:52.424 --> 00:44:54.551
and I gotta shut it down
by the end of the month.

670
00:44:54.659 --> 00:44:57.287
-You guys are getting out of drugs?
-Yeah, for a while.

671
00:44:57.395 --> 00:44:59.920
We just don't have the manpower
to stay on anything big.

672
00:45:00.031 --> 00:45:02.022
Not since those towers fell.

673
00:45:02.133 --> 00:45:05.000
What, we don't have enough love
in our hearts for two wars?

674
00:45:06.304 --> 00:45:09.205
-Joke's on us, huh?
-I guess so.

675
00:45:09.374 --> 00:45:13.435
Still and all, you give great case, brother.
I wish you could've worked it with us.

676
00:45:29.394 --> 00:45:32.090
Got some Tech Nine over here,
over here, Tech Nine.

677
00:45:38.803 --> 00:45:42.239
That's it, here's $20, hook it up.

678
00:45:44.175 --> 00:45:45.199
Two and two.

679
00:45:45.310 --> 00:45:46.743
-Hold up.
-What?

680
00:45:46.845 --> 00:45:50.076
-Just two and two.
-Come on, man, I ain't got time for this.

681
00:45:50.181 --> 00:45:52.012
-I gave you $20, man.
-You gave me $20?

682
00:45:52.117 --> 00:45:53.084
One and a short three.

683
00:45:53.184 --> 00:45:55.277
-So you get, two--
-$7.

684
00:45:55.387 --> 00:45:57.412
-Hold up.
-I get $7 back. Come on, man.

685
00:45:57.789 --> 00:45:59.188
Calm down.

686
00:46:01.526 --> 00:46:04.017
Hold up, hold up, you fucking me up.
Chill out.

687
00:46:06.564 --> 00:46:08.327
You dropping shit on the ground?

688
00:46:09.067 --> 00:46:11.627
-Hold up.
-I ain't got all day.

689
00:46:11.803 --> 00:46:14.237
Come on, man, it's easy. Let's rewind, man.

690
00:46:14.339 --> 00:46:18.366
What the fuck is you doing?
Look at this shit. Look, nigger.

691
00:46:18.476 --> 00:46:20.068
That's the motherfucker right there.

692
00:46:20.178 --> 00:46:21.645
-Who?
-The white boy right there.

693
00:46:21.746 --> 00:46:23.475
Poot, grab that motherfucker.

694
00:46:23.915 --> 00:46:25.780
The white boy.

695
00:46:26.651 --> 00:46:28.050
Hold up, man.

696
00:46:38.229 --> 00:46:39.992
Stop that white motherfucker.

697
00:46:40.398 --> 00:46:44.459
Yeah, motherfucker, yeah, nigger. Fuck that.

698
00:46:44.569 --> 00:46:45.831
What are you doing, man?

699
00:46:46.337 --> 00:46:47.668
Calm down, man.

700
00:46:47.772 --> 00:46:49.899
Making me run,
what the fuck is wrong with you?

701
00:46:50.008 --> 00:46:52.841
-What, man, why you fucking with me?
-Shit.

702
00:46:52.944 --> 00:46:55.742
This the motherfucker right here
with the make-believe money.

703
00:46:55.847 --> 00:46:57.314
Seen his ass drop it and shit.

704
00:46:57.415 --> 00:47:00.543
-Wasn't me.
-Motherfucker.

705
00:47:00.719 --> 00:47:04.177
It was this nigger, I saw him.
Get the fuck up.

706
00:47:05.490 --> 00:47:07.253
All right, listen, I'm sorry.

707
00:47:07.759 --> 00:47:08.748
Fuck that.

708
00:47:08.860 --> 00:47:11.385
What we need to do is,
motherfucker burned us for $30.

709
00:47:11.496 --> 00:47:13.054
We need to take him to Franklin Ave...

710
00:47:13.164 --> 00:47:15.962
and throw his ass right
onto the motherfucking expressway.

711
00:47:16.134 --> 00:47:19.865
All right, listen, I'm fucking sorry.
I fucked up, man.

712
00:47:19.971 --> 00:47:23.805
-What you got on you?
-Just the $10 I dropped, man, the real one.

713
00:47:40.992 --> 00:47:42.425
What's up?

714
00:47:51.970 --> 00:47:53.437
Fuck it.

715
00:47:56.708 --> 00:47:58.369
Hell, yeah.

716
00:48:05.016 --> 00:48:08.247
For now, we'll work out of Narcotics,
with Kima keeping the file.

717
00:48:08.353 --> 00:48:11.447
We'll copy everything to Ronnie
at the courthouse and your people.

718
00:48:11.556 --> 00:48:12.523
Fine with us.

719
00:48:12.624 --> 00:48:15.457
McNulty and Santangelo will work
on the open murders...

720
00:48:15.560 --> 00:48:17.152
see if anything can be manufactured.

721
00:48:17.262 --> 00:48:20.288
Kima and my people will do
hand-to-hand stuff in the Terrace.

722
00:48:20.398 --> 00:48:21.729
Buy-bust, quick and dirty.

723
00:48:21.833 --> 00:48:24.825
We put years over top of
some of these people, we'll roll a few.

724
00:48:24.936 --> 00:48:27.370
You're not gonna get
Avon Barksdale or Stringer Bell...

725
00:48:27.472 --> 00:48:29.906
or anyone else above the street,
not on street rips.

726
00:48:30.008 --> 00:48:32.169
-You don't know that.
-These guys are good.

727
00:48:32.277 --> 00:48:35.440
They're deep and organized.
They've got everyone running scared.

728
00:48:35.547 --> 00:48:36.741
What do you suggest?

729
00:48:37.081 --> 00:48:39.948
Surveillance teams,
DNRs, asset investigation.

730
00:48:40.051 --> 00:48:42.144
Keep gathering string
till we can find a way in.

731
00:48:42.253 --> 00:48:45.518
Either a wired CI or a Title Ill.
That's what makes this case.

732
00:48:45.623 --> 00:48:47.420
Is that what you told the judge?

733
00:48:48.126 --> 00:48:51.493
Okay, so I'm an asshole for that.
But I'm right about this much.

734
00:48:52.997 --> 00:48:55.989
No mics, no wires.
We do this fast and clean and simple.

735
00:48:56.100 --> 00:48:57.567
Then you don't do it at all.

736
00:48:57.969 --> 00:49:02.702
Seems to me you all could've had this fight
before calling the State's Attorney's office.

737
00:49:03.208 --> 00:49:06.666
Let me ask you something.
What do we know about Avon Barksdale?

738
00:49:07.145 --> 00:49:08.442
What do we know?

739
00:49:08.913 --> 00:49:11.973
The guy's owned
all of Franklin Terrace for a year.

740
00:49:12.350 --> 00:49:15.945
What do we have on him right now?
A DOB? A sheet?

741
00:49:16.221 --> 00:49:17.586
A B of I photo?

742
00:49:18.156 --> 00:49:20.124
We don't even have
a fucking photo of the guy.

743
00:49:20.225 --> 00:49:21.419
Gimme a break, Jimmy.

744
00:49:21.993 --> 00:49:25.292
Two days ago no one on this fucking floor
knew this mope's name.

745
00:49:25.396 --> 00:49:27.364
Now he's some kinda criminal mastermind.

746
00:49:27.465 --> 00:49:30.923
Shit, I say we go down to the Terrace
and fuck some people up.

747
00:49:32.637 --> 00:49:35.629
You all don't need a prosecutor,
you need a fucking referee.

748
00:49:35.740 --> 00:49:38.038
When you know how
you're playing this, give a yell.

749
00:49:38.142 --> 00:49:39.734
We know how we're playing it.

750
00:49:39.944 --> 00:49:42.310
My people are going down
to do some hand-to-hands.

751
00:49:42.413 --> 00:49:46.577
Detectives McNulty and Santangelo are
going to the hall to review old murder files...

752
00:49:46.684 --> 00:49:48.948
and try to manufacture a fresh prosecution.

753
00:49:49.053 --> 00:49:52.181
As things heat up, I'll go to the deputy
and get us more manpower...

754
00:49:52.290 --> 00:49:54.019
but this case is not going to sprawl.

755
00:49:54.125 --> 00:49:57.060
A month from now,
we're all gonna be back at our day jobs.

756
00:49:57.328 --> 00:49:59.421
Fine. Bring me your hand-to-hands.

757
00:49:59.530 --> 00:50:02.988
Anything on the murders, you can take
to llene Nathan in violent crimes.

758
00:50:03.101 --> 00:50:04.568
I'll clue her in.

759
00:50:08.606 --> 00:50:10.073
Anything else?

760
00:50:12.377 --> 00:50:14.402
One last thing:

761
00:50:14.512 --> 00:50:18.312
No one does anything at all on the street
without me knowing about it first.

762
00:50:20.718 --> 00:50:22.515
Chain-of-command, Detective.

763
00:50:22.887 --> 00:50:25.617
That's how we do things
down this end of the hall.

764
00:50:31.229 --> 00:50:34.164
If she's fucking you on visitation,
take her ass to court.

765
00:50:34.265 --> 00:50:35.630
Not that simple, Bunk.

766
00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:39.463
Judge gives me three weekends out of four,
I still need her to cooperate.

767
00:50:39.570 --> 00:50:41.003
You know, move it around...

768
00:50:42.173 --> 00:50:45.267
so when I have to work through a weekend,
she switches with me.

769
00:50:45.376 --> 00:50:47.844
The judge gives me
three weekends but no flex...

770
00:50:47.946 --> 00:50:49.436
I still lose.

771
00:50:49.814 --> 00:50:53.147
-You two can't talk this through?
-No.

772
00:50:54.619 --> 00:50:57.679
How is it you always got
the whole world pissed off at you?

773
00:50:59.090 --> 00:51:01.923
You know Daniels? Narcotics?

774
00:51:02.093 --> 00:51:04.755
-What about him?
-He's running this detail.

775
00:51:05.897 --> 00:51:08.832
-Watch your ass then.
-He a snake?

776
00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:12.401
No, he ain't that. But he's a company man.

777
00:51:12.804 --> 00:51:14.499
You know, a prospect.

778
00:51:15.106 --> 00:51:17.700
Grapevine says the next district
to open up is his.

779
00:51:17.875 --> 00:51:19.399
Shortlist for major?

780
00:51:20.211 --> 00:51:23.203
He's black, he's still young,
he hasn't pissed anybody off.

781
00:51:23.848 --> 00:51:26.544
-Shit, he even has a law degree.
-No shit.

782
00:51:26.651 --> 00:51:31.054
-University of Baltimore, but still, you know.
-He's gonna fuck this Barksdale thing up.

783
00:51:31.522 --> 00:51:33.888
-How's that?
-Buy-bust?

784
00:51:34.325 --> 00:51:38.125
-He's pissing in the wind.
-You already fucked it up, Jimmy.

785
00:51:38.596 --> 00:51:40.188
You made it happen.

786
00:51:41.933 --> 00:51:45.630
I feel like that motherfucker
at the end of Bridge On The River Kwai.

787
00:51:45.737 --> 00:51:49.400
-What the fuck did I do?
-The bridge of what?

788
00:51:49.707 --> 00:51:51.470
You ain't seen that movie?

789
00:51:52.844 --> 00:51:54.539
I am fucked.

790
00:51:58.616 --> 00:52:00.015
Fucked is me.

791
00:52:02.320 --> 00:52:05.050
God damn it, you gonna make me
go another round.

792
00:52:06.057 --> 00:52:07.888
Two more.

793
00:52:18.136 --> 00:52:21.196
-It's all in the game.
-I'm saying it was only a couple dollars.

794
00:52:21.305 --> 00:52:23.865
-It ain't the money.
-But we fucked him up so bad.

795
00:52:24.242 --> 00:52:25.869
It's the message, Dee.

796
00:52:27.478 --> 00:52:29.309
You can't show no weakness.

797
00:52:30.715 --> 00:52:32.546
-Still, I'm saying.
-What?

798
00:52:43.594 --> 00:52:44.686
String.

799
00:53:06.818 --> 00:53:10.117
You ain't touched that drink.
You want some company?

800
00:53:11.222 --> 00:53:14.385
-I ain't no john.
-Good, 'cause I ain't no whore.

801
00:53:15.426 --> 00:53:17.451
I'm not a regular, okay?

802
00:53:17.562 --> 00:53:20.156
-I work for Stringer.
-He pay you, don't he?

803
00:53:22.266 --> 00:53:23.961
Come on, buy me a drink.

804
00:53:26.637 --> 00:53:29.105
-How much?
-$20.

805
00:53:30.808 --> 00:53:32.105
I drink slow.

806
00:53:37.181 --> 00:53:38.546
Maybe another time.

807
00:53:53.564 --> 00:53:56.795
-Buy me a drink, honey?
-How about you buy me a drink?

808
00:54:00.138 --> 00:54:02.299
Carla. One here.

809
00:54:26.631 --> 00:54:29.156
-Where you at?
-Where you think?

810
00:54:32.937 --> 00:54:35.838
-You late for work?
-A little.

811
00:54:38.209 --> 00:54:41.042
-How much you got left?
-Girl, please.

812
00:54:41.679 --> 00:54:45.809
-Ten pages and all the footnotes.
-When's it due?

813
00:54:46.250 --> 00:54:48.309
Tomorrow, beginning of class.

814
00:54:53.658 --> 00:54:55.285
Long night for you.

815
00:54:58.262 --> 00:54:59.786
Long night for me.

816
00:55:04.936 --> 00:55:06.961
I'll make sure and pick up some coffee.

817
00:55:17.348 --> 00:55:20.146
So, I drive all the way down
to Liberty Road...

818
00:55:20.251 --> 00:55:23.414
at 2:00 in the damn morning,
on a midnight shift...

819
00:55:23.521 --> 00:55:26.615
I got two murders and a police shooting
going down, to do what?

820
00:55:26.824 --> 00:55:29.486
To get a goddamn mouse
out of my wife's bedroom closet.

821
00:55:29.594 --> 00:55:31.084
Can you imagine that shit?

822
00:55:31.963 --> 00:55:33.396
So what did you do?

823
00:55:35.032 --> 00:55:36.021
What the fuck you think?

824
00:55:36.133 --> 00:55:39.159
I got the mouse out as fast as I could
and drove back to work.

825
00:55:39.270 --> 00:55:40.862
Couldn't do nothing else.

826
00:55:42.240 --> 00:55:45.573
Nadine out of her fucking mind
over this little-ass field mouse.

827
00:55:45.676 --> 00:55:47.610
She's up on the chair and shit
when I come...

828
00:55:47.712 --> 00:55:49.577
Iike some goddamn cartoon.

829
00:55:50.314 --> 00:55:53.647
-I mean, how'd you catch the mouse?
-Catch him? I lit his ass up.

830
00:55:56.921 --> 00:55:58.388
You shot the mouse?

831
00:55:58.990 --> 00:56:00.457
With your nine?

832
00:56:00.858 --> 00:56:02.883
First shot killed my wife's dress shoe.

833
00:56:03.628 --> 00:56:05.220
Got him with the second.

834
00:56:12.637 --> 00:56:13.763
What?

835
00:56:15.373 --> 00:56:17.500
You shot a mouse
with your service weapon?

836
00:56:17.608 --> 00:56:18.666
Yeah.

837
00:56:19.810 --> 00:56:21.539
What'd you do with the carcass?

838
00:56:21.646 --> 00:56:23.477
I cleaned it up, you know.

839
00:56:23.648 --> 00:56:26.139
I thought about leaving
that little motherfucker...

840
00:56:26.250 --> 00:56:28.081
as a warning to the others.

841
00:56:35.826 --> 00:56:37.191
Fuck me.

842
00:56:40.998 --> 00:56:45.492
It's 3:30 in the morning.
I'm supposed to be early relief.

843
00:56:46.037 --> 00:56:49.803
Jimmy, man,
I gotta change my clothes at least, come on.

844
00:56:50.408 --> 00:56:52.000
I'm gonna do this case.

845
00:56:55.146 --> 00:56:56.408
What?

846
00:56:56.514 --> 00:56:59.950
I'm gonna do this case
the way it should be done.

847
00:57:00.584 --> 00:57:02.848
It's a buy-bust, Jimmy, get in and get out.

848
00:57:03.054 --> 00:57:04.885
-Fuck that.
-Jimmy.

849
00:57:15.099 --> 00:57:16.794
Let's call it a night.

850
00:57:40.858 --> 00:57:42.086
Hi, Bubbs.

851
00:57:44.495 --> 00:57:46.258
Thought you was still locked up.

852
00:57:47.498 --> 00:57:48.658
Nope.

853
00:57:50.901 --> 00:57:52.596
How long you been home?

854
00:57:54.138 --> 00:57:55.605
It's been three months.

855
00:57:57.141 --> 00:57:59.166
You don't write, you don't call.

856
00:58:02.313 --> 00:58:03.746
Who's he?

857
00:58:05.616 --> 00:58:06.844
A friend.

858
00:58:09.587 --> 00:58:11.214
Is he gonna make it?

859
00:58:17.628 --> 00:58:19.357
You still working drugs?

860
00:58:22.366 --> 00:58:24.027
Downtown, yeah.

861
00:58:27.004 --> 00:58:28.835
I got something for you.

862
00:58:40.718 --> 00:58:43.448
-Last call.
-Fuck.

863
00:58:44.622 --> 00:58:47.682
Found body. 200, Block Amity.

864
00:58:47.825 --> 00:58:49.850
I'm a little thin today, boss.

865
00:58:50.394 --> 00:58:54.057
The whole squad's a little thin, remember?

866
00:58:54.765 --> 00:58:58.428
We're down a man
since your partner got himself detailed.

867
00:59:01.138 --> 00:59:03.038
Yeah.

868
00:59:04.341 --> 00:59:05.501
I got it.

869
00:59:16.987 --> 00:59:18.215
Jesus.

870
00:59:34.905 --> 00:59:37.396
-How you doing, Bobby?
-Bunk, what's going on, man?

871
00:59:38.542 --> 00:59:41.033
We got one or two shots to the head.

872
00:59:41.512 --> 00:59:43.207
No witnesses, no suspects.

873
00:59:44.281 --> 00:59:46.215
You got a .380 casing on the ground there.

874
00:59:46.317 --> 00:59:48.410
Buddy, do me a favor, bag that for me?

875
00:59:48.686 --> 00:59:51.814
So, who called it in?

876
00:59:52.156 --> 00:59:54.021
No one. 21 Post found him.

877
00:59:54.692 --> 00:59:58.594
It's a William Gant, 42, no, 43 years old...

878
00:59:59.396 --> 01:00:00.829
address on Schroeder.

879
01:00:00.931 --> 01:00:03.161
-You got pictures?
-Yeah, we got them.

880
01:00:03.267 --> 01:00:04.894
Okay, let's roll him.

881
01:00:10.140 --> 01:00:12.870
Mr. Gant, do you see the man
you identified...

882
01:00:12.977 --> 01:00:14.877
sitting in the courtroom today?

883
01:00:15.813 --> 01:00:17.280
He's right there.
