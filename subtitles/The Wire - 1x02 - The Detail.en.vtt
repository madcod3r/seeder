1
00:00:10.042 --> 00:00:13.705
That's the witness all right,
the one from the Barksdale case.

2
00:00:13.813 --> 00:00:16.543
Gant, William. 41 years.

3
00:00:16.983 --> 00:00:21.113
Single headshot, close range.
Bullet pancaked on the inner skull.

4
00:00:27.059 --> 00:00:29.289
-Ain't necessarily what it looks like.
-No?

5
00:00:29.395 --> 00:00:31.590
A man's walking down a street
in West Baltimore.

6
00:00:31.697 --> 00:00:33.961
That'll catch you a bullet
for a half-dozen reasons.

7
00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:36.762
-Yeah, that it will.
-You run him for a sheet?

8
00:00:36.869 --> 00:00:38.734
Yeah, a couple of disorderlies is all.

9
00:00:38.838 --> 00:00:40.829
Guy works maintenance
down at Poe Homes.

10
00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.135
Lives alone, no wife, no kids.

11
00:00:43.242 --> 00:00:45.767
Only time his name pops up
on the courthouse computer...

12
00:00:45.878 --> 00:00:47.903
is for being a state witness in Barlow's case.

13
00:00:48.014 --> 00:00:50.539
Otherwise,
I don't even make that connection.

14
00:00:53.886 --> 00:00:55.717
I mean, you've got to admit...

15
00:00:55.822 --> 00:00:59.053
it don't make sense to ace this motherfucker
after he done testified.

16
00:00:59.158 --> 00:01:00.557
Sends a hell of a message though.

17
00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.528
He's one hardheaded fuck in the Terrace
you can't run off or buy out, right?

18
00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:08.760
If your audience is the high-rise projects,
a move like this cuts right through the shit.

19
00:01:08.868 --> 00:01:10.301
What are you gonna tell the major?

20
00:01:10.403 --> 00:01:13.099
That I caught a stone fucking whodunit.

21
00:01:13.206 --> 00:01:16.039
-Don't soft-sell the witness angle.
-Come on.

22
00:01:16.142 --> 00:01:19.339
Why get the bosses riled
before we know for sure?

23
00:01:19.445 --> 00:01:21.743
If I start talking shit
that a witness got killed--

24
00:01:21.848 --> 00:01:23.440
-Bunk, tell him.
-Why?

25
00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.312
Just cover yourself on this.

26
00:01:25.418 --> 00:01:28.910
Jimmy, you ain't gonna do what I think?

27
00:01:31.324 --> 00:01:32.757
Listen to me.

28
00:01:33.326 --> 00:01:36.159
This shit is gonna jump up
and bite you in your ass.

29
00:01:36.262 --> 00:01:37.991
Just cover yourself.

30
00:01:38.865 --> 00:01:42.767
-What the hell was that about?
-Nothing.

31
00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.234
Morning.

32
00:04:20.292 --> 00:04:21.919
Jesus Christ.

33
00:04:31.871 --> 00:04:33.566
Goddamn.

34
00:04:34.106 --> 00:04:37.564
Who do you got to fuck in this town
to get a real office?

35
00:04:38.744 --> 00:04:40.473
At least that works.

36
00:04:51.991 --> 00:04:53.686
It was for McNulty.

37
00:04:57.296 --> 00:04:59.560
-I shouldn't be here.
-Then you shouldn't.

38
00:04:59.665 --> 00:05:02.156
They killed a fucking witness
out of your court.

39
00:05:02.268 --> 00:05:04.964
Yeah, you told me. You did your civic duty.

40
00:05:05.071 --> 00:05:08.404
Under the power vested in me
by the circuit court for Baltimore city...

41
00:05:08.507 --> 00:05:10.941
I absolve you of all your sins,
Detective McNulty.

42
00:05:11.043 --> 00:05:12.840
You are my sin, you know that?

43
00:05:12.945 --> 00:05:15.413
For talking to you,
my major is ready to cut my throat.

44
00:05:15.514 --> 00:05:18.540
Jimmy, you knew I was gonna
make that call. Admit it.

45
00:05:18.651 --> 00:05:22.587
I didn't think you would straight-up
hang me out on the line in a shitstorm.

46
00:05:23.456 --> 00:05:26.118
Look, it's not like it was
when I was a prosecutor.

47
00:05:26.225 --> 00:05:29.285
-I'm a judge now, the rules are different.
-You missed a spot.

48
00:05:29.395 --> 00:05:31.363
Yeah, what's done is done.

49
00:05:32.465 --> 00:05:34.933
Question is,
what do you want me to do now?

50
00:05:35.434 --> 00:05:38.130
I think you can leverage the Deputy Ops
with a phone call.

51
00:05:38.237 --> 00:05:40.467
-He's already detailed people.
-Some detail.

52
00:05:40.573 --> 00:05:43.838
Asshole lieutenant thinks
he can buy-bust his way to Avon Barksdale.

53
00:05:43.943 --> 00:05:45.342
You want leverage?

54
00:05:45.444 --> 00:05:48.140
We give the dead-witness angle
to the newspapers.

55
00:05:48.247 --> 00:05:49.441
Stir some real shit.

56
00:05:49.548 --> 00:05:51.880
No, that tips Barksdale
that someone's working him.

57
00:05:51.984 --> 00:05:54.214
-We don't want to go public.
-No?

58
00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:55.878
Just put it to the Deputy Ops...

59
00:05:55.988 --> 00:05:58.115
you lost a witness
who testified in your court.

60
00:05:58.224 --> 00:06:01.022
That forces the department
to commit to the investigation.

61
00:06:01.127 --> 00:06:04.858
And when you call Burrell this time,
will you forget my fucking name?

62
00:06:12.872 --> 00:06:16.103
-You missed a spot.
-Why don't you fucking do it?

63
00:06:16.208 --> 00:06:17.505
Seniority.

64
00:06:33.526 --> 00:06:35.619
-You found us.
-Wasn't easy.

65
00:06:36.529 --> 00:06:39.930
-You asked for these guys?
-I asked for more manpower.

66
00:06:42.201 --> 00:06:43.566
Have a seat.

67
00:06:52.511 --> 00:06:54.103
What the fuck....

68
00:06:56.248 --> 00:06:57.977
Sir, l--

69
00:06:58.083 --> 00:07:00.517
He was showing me
the trigger pull on his Glock.

70
00:07:00.619 --> 00:07:04.146
-And he was just--
-Detective?

71
00:07:04.723 --> 00:07:07.749
Officer Pryzbylewski shot the wall,
Lieutenant.

72
00:07:08.727 --> 00:07:09.751
Why?

73
00:07:09.862 --> 00:07:12.592
Why did you shoot the wall,
Officer Pryzbylewski?

74
00:07:12.698 --> 00:07:16.134
I was just showing Carv
how my trigger pull is light, you know.

75
00:07:16.902 --> 00:07:20.065
-I got it so it's real light.
-He took the clip out, boss.

76
00:07:20.539 --> 00:07:22.063
But not the one in the chamber.

77
00:07:22.174 --> 00:07:26.338
No, I forgot the one in the chamber, and....

78
00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:31.176
Shit, I'm sorry, lieutenant.

79
00:07:31.684 --> 00:07:34.118
-You want him to write on it?
-Write on what?

80
00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:38.350
You let one go, you got to write.
You got to justify the use of deadly force.

81
00:07:39.124 --> 00:07:40.989
Against a plaster wall.

82
00:07:42.595 --> 00:07:45.962
It's an accident, okay?
Give me a fucking break already.

83
00:07:46.065 --> 00:07:49.057
-Your name is what?
-Pryzbylewski.

84
00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:54.434
From Auto Unit, right? Cantrell sent you.

85
00:07:56.108 --> 00:07:57.473
Not exactly.

86
00:07:57.576 --> 00:08:01.910
Lt. Cantrell sent me
to Casualty Section a couple months back.

87
00:08:02.648 --> 00:08:04.912
And I asked out of Casualty.

88
00:08:09.054 --> 00:08:11.545
You came here from Casualty Section?

89
00:08:13.859 --> 00:08:16.054
Man, these shits is right, yo.

90
00:08:20.299 --> 00:08:23.530
-It's good with the hot sauce, too.
-Most definite.

91
00:08:24.236 --> 00:08:27.603
-Dee, want some nuggets?
-No, go ahead, man.

92
00:08:27.706 --> 00:08:30.766
Man, whoever invented these,
he off the hook.

93
00:08:30.876 --> 00:08:31.934
Word!

94
00:08:32.945 --> 00:08:35.914
Motherfucker got the bone
all the way out the damn chicken.

95
00:08:36.015 --> 00:08:38.916
Till he came along,
niggas be chewing on drumsticks and shit...

96
00:08:39.018 --> 00:08:40.986
getting their fingers all greasy.

97
00:08:41.086 --> 00:08:42.849
He said "Later" to the bone.

98
00:08:43.322 --> 00:08:46.018
Nugget that meat up
and make some real money.

99
00:08:46.125 --> 00:08:48.457
-You think the man got paid?
-Who?

100
00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:51.723
-Man who invented these.
-Shit, he richer than a motherfucker.

101
00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:54.492
Why? You think he get a percentage?

102
00:08:55.134 --> 00:08:56.294
Why not?

103
00:08:56.435 --> 00:08:59.563
Nigga, please, the man
who invented them things...

104
00:08:59.672 --> 00:09:02.106
just some sad-ass down
at the basement of McDonald's...

105
00:09:02.207 --> 00:09:04.767
thinking up some shit
to make money for the real players.

106
00:09:04.877 --> 00:09:07.243
-No man, that ain't right.
-Fuck right.

107
00:09:07.446 --> 00:09:09.778
It ain't about right, it's about money.

108
00:09:09.882 --> 00:09:12.373
You think Ronald McDonald
gonna go down that basement...

109
00:09:12.484 --> 00:09:15.112
and say, "Mr. Nugget, you the bomb.

110
00:09:15.254 --> 00:09:17.882
"We selling chicken faster
than you can tear the bone out.

111
00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:21.824
"So, I'm gonna write my clowny-ass name
on this fat-ass check for you."

112
00:09:22.561 --> 00:09:23.619
Shit.

113
00:09:24.663 --> 00:09:26.358
The nigger who invented them things...

114
00:09:26.465 --> 00:09:28.626
still working in the basement
for regular wage...

115
00:09:28.734 --> 00:09:32.067
thinking of some shit
to make the fries taste better.

116
00:09:32.371 --> 00:09:33.565
Believe.

117
00:09:37.876 --> 00:09:40.037
He still had the idea, though.

118
00:09:47.119 --> 00:09:48.108
Who?

119
00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:51.314
Polk and Pat Mahone.
A couple of drunks from Property.

120
00:09:51.423 --> 00:09:53.186
-I don't know them.
-Why would you?

121
00:09:53.292 --> 00:09:55.760
They haven't made a case in 10 years.

122
00:09:55.861 --> 00:09:59.058
Also got handed some kid
named Prezbelowski or Prezbelewski--

123
00:09:59.164 --> 00:10:02.258
-Pryzbylewski, him, I know.
-Yeah?

124
00:10:02.668 --> 00:10:06.160
-Why was he in Casualty Section?
-He shot up his own car.

125
00:10:06.271 --> 00:10:08.603
-You remember?
-He did what?

126
00:10:08.707 --> 00:10:12.143
He fired two clips into an unmarked car,
somewhere out in West Baltimore.

127
00:10:12.244 --> 00:10:16.146
Called in a Signal 13 on the radio,
like he was under fire from a sniper.

128
00:10:16.248 --> 00:10:18.079
You didn't hear about that?

129
00:10:18.183 --> 00:10:21.744
He stuck to his story for half a day,
until Ballistics matched the bullet...

130
00:10:21.854 --> 00:10:23.253
to his off-duty weapon.

131
00:10:23.355 --> 00:10:26.119
-We almost indicted him for false report.
-Why didn't you?

132
00:10:26.225 --> 00:10:29.456
He's got some kind of suction
with the Mayor's office. I'm not sure.

133
00:10:29.561 --> 00:10:32.655
My point is, I can't build much
with the garbage they sent me.

134
00:10:32.765 --> 00:10:35.859
So, go to the deputy, right?
You've got his ear on this.

135
00:10:38.037 --> 00:10:39.095
Why not?

136
00:10:39.571 --> 00:10:41.402
I ask the deputy for manpower.

137
00:10:41.507 --> 00:10:44.965
He then tells Property to send me two men,
and Special to send two more.

138
00:10:45.077 --> 00:10:46.339
And those shift lieutenants...

139
00:10:46.445 --> 00:10:48.538
they know it's a chance
to dump their deadwood.

140
00:10:48.647 --> 00:10:50.911
The deputy, he knows this, too.

141
00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:53.746
He could have offered
to let me pick but he didn't.

142
00:10:53.852 --> 00:10:56.412
-He sent me a message on this.
-And the message is?

143
00:10:56.522 --> 00:10:58.717
Don't dig in, don't get fancy.

144
00:10:59.191 --> 00:11:02.024
Put a quick charge on this Barksdale
and then get out.

145
00:11:02.127 --> 00:11:05.221
If he sends me good police,
I might do good police work.

146
00:11:06.865 --> 00:11:10.357
-But if the state's attorney's office were to--
-No, no.

147
00:11:22.481 --> 00:11:24.108
Rhonda, darling...

148
00:11:24.716 --> 00:11:28.584
it's bad protocol for me to ask for help
and then trash the help I'm given.

149
00:11:28.687 --> 00:11:30.587
-You, on the other hand--
-No way.

150
00:11:30.689 --> 00:11:32.520
My office doesn't play that way.

151
00:11:32.624 --> 00:11:35.218
You people staff your cases,
you bring us casework.

152
00:11:35.327 --> 00:11:38.228
I cross that line, I only piss everyone off.

153
00:11:40.599 --> 00:11:43.500
Best I can do is tell my unit chief
that you drew shit.

154
00:11:43.602 --> 00:11:44.899
He wants to take it upstairs...

155
00:11:45.003 --> 00:11:47.164
call the deputy for operations,
that's his choice.

156
00:11:47.272 --> 00:11:49.638
-That won't happen.
-Probably not.

157
00:11:52.244 --> 00:11:53.711
Make lemonade.

158
00:12:18.871 --> 00:12:19.929
Fuck!

159
00:12:20.239 --> 00:12:22.469
Yo, Kima, where you taking us?

160
00:12:23.142 --> 00:12:24.666
-Get down.
-What?

161
00:12:24.776 --> 00:12:27.836
Jesus. You all ain't got no creep to you.

162
00:12:28.247 --> 00:12:30.238
Pair of goddamn elephants.

163
00:12:33.552 --> 00:12:36.146
A rusted nail just went through my shoe.

164
00:12:36.255 --> 00:12:39.588
I'm gonna need a tetanus
to get behind this bullshit.

165
00:12:43.028 --> 00:12:45.758
-Kima.
-Hand me that bag.

166
00:12:51.203 --> 00:12:53.603
Kima, if you don't mind me asking...

167
00:12:53.972 --> 00:12:58.102
when was it that you first figured
you liked women better than men?

168
00:12:58.677 --> 00:13:00.304
I mind you asking.

169
00:13:07.719 --> 00:13:10.882
Gentlemen, what's going on there, guys?

170
00:13:10.989 --> 00:13:13.480
-Testers, man, already out.
-No.

171
00:13:13.592 --> 00:13:17.221
I'm not in need of your services, bro.
I'm offering my services to y'all.

172
00:13:17.329 --> 00:13:18.694
What you got in the bag, man?

173
00:13:18.797 --> 00:13:22.927
One thing a gentleman of color like better
than a new pair of downtown shoes...

174
00:13:23.035 --> 00:13:25.003
is a downtown brim, right?

175
00:13:53.465 --> 00:13:55.228
What's with the hats?

176
00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:07.610
-Five-o!
-Five-o!

177
00:14:08.113 --> 00:14:09.546
Shut it down!

178
00:14:19.358 --> 00:14:20.484
Clean?

179
00:14:50.088 --> 00:14:53.216
You ain't gonna put that one on me.
He a witness.

180
00:14:53.325 --> 00:14:57.193
You picked that shit up off the ground,
so don't be trying to put shit on me.

181
00:14:57.296 --> 00:14:59.662
Is that what you think I'm about?

182
00:15:00.599 --> 00:15:02.863
Boy thinks I'm gonna dirty him.

183
00:15:03.068 --> 00:15:05.002
Like y'all won't do it.

184
00:15:05.103 --> 00:15:08.095
You Western knockos come here,
picking shit up off the ground...

185
00:15:08.206 --> 00:15:10.174
putting it on whoever you damn well please.

186
00:15:10.275 --> 00:15:11.742
Do I know you?

187
00:15:13.045 --> 00:15:16.446
Let's understand each other.
I'm not Western District.

188
00:15:16.548 --> 00:15:19.278
I'm not a knocko. I don't dirty people...

189
00:15:19.384 --> 00:15:21.511
because I don't care
about a possession charge.

190
00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:24.953
I'm a Murder Police,
I'm here about the bodies.

191
00:15:26.224 --> 00:15:29.421
D'Angelo here knows that.
He remembers me from the trial, right?

192
00:15:29.528 --> 00:15:33.464
I'm sitting in back there, behind Stringer,
watching, listening.

193
00:15:33.565 --> 00:15:36.056
Y'all hassling me about that shit?

194
00:15:36.234 --> 00:15:38.168
I thought you heard
what the jury had to say.

195
00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:40.261
-Fuck the jury.
-Yeah, fuck the jury.

196
00:15:40.372 --> 00:15:41.839
This is just us talking, right?

197
00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:45.467
Just you, me, my partner and....
What did you say your name was?

198
00:15:45.577 --> 00:15:46.874
I didn't say shit.

199
00:15:46.978 --> 00:15:49.845
Just you, me, my partner and Mr. Shit here.

200
00:15:50.349 --> 00:15:52.579
We're just talking
about how things go, right?

201
00:15:52.684 --> 00:15:55.118
We are just sharing our thoughts here.

202
00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:59.486
-Bunk, a vial for your thoughts.
-I'm thinking it's one thing for one of you...

203
00:15:59.591 --> 00:16:02.219
Iittle Terrace niggers
to shoot somebody in the lobby...

204
00:16:02.327 --> 00:16:04.887
of the 221 building, you know?
Who gives a fuck?

205
00:16:04.996 --> 00:16:07.021
-But when you ace a witness...
-A working man.

206
00:16:07.132 --> 00:16:09.293
...who ain't even in the game....

207
00:16:10.435 --> 00:16:12.733
You gonna act like this is news?

208
00:16:13.939 --> 00:16:17.670
I tell you this, I don't know shit about shit,
but I do know this...

209
00:16:17.909 --> 00:16:21.436
anyone who spend time witnessing shit,
you gonna get got.

210
00:16:22.481 --> 00:16:26.645
I know that sounds kind of harsh,
but that's the way things go around here...

211
00:16:26.752 --> 00:16:27.946
officer.

212
00:16:30.522 --> 00:16:31.853
Let's roll.

213
00:16:43.468 --> 00:16:47.268
That how you see things, D'Angelo?
Like your friend here?

214
00:16:53.011 --> 00:16:56.538
I'm here trying to outfit niggers
with something to rile up some pussy.

215
00:16:56.648 --> 00:16:59.674
You don't want to know,
Bubbles used to get that pussy.

216
00:17:00.585 --> 00:17:03.179
I reckon the pussy ain't worth
what it used to be...

217
00:17:03.288 --> 00:17:05.313
if you can do it without
a proper brim, right?

218
00:17:05.424 --> 00:17:07.016
Come on, big man.

219
00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:31.041
-Something's up.
-What?

220
00:17:32.117 --> 00:17:33.448
Don't know.

221
00:17:36.555 --> 00:17:38.546
Yo, Carv. Come here.

222
00:17:39.624 --> 00:17:41.922
Listen, you see Bubbs
put a hat on anybody...

223
00:17:42.027 --> 00:17:43.494
you take some pictures, all right?

224
00:17:43.595 --> 00:17:45.586
-Yeah?
-Especially the red one.

225
00:17:45.697 --> 00:17:48.825
If you see him put that red hat
on anybody's head...

226
00:17:48.934 --> 00:17:50.595
snap your fucking fingers off.

227
00:17:50.702 --> 00:17:52.226
Where you going?

228
00:17:53.572 --> 00:17:56.268
Yo, Carv. Notice that most of the time...

229
00:17:56.374 --> 00:17:59.104
it's like Kima thinks
she's above us or something?

230
00:17:59.211 --> 00:18:01.975
I mean, I don't see any stripes
on her fucking sleeve...

231
00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:03.547
I don't see that.

232
00:18:04.049 --> 00:18:06.074
All I see is some stuck-up dyke bitch...

233
00:18:06.184 --> 00:18:08.584
who ain't been in CID
half the time of you or me...

234
00:18:08.687 --> 00:18:10.917
and she's fucking telling us what to do.

235
00:18:11.022 --> 00:18:14.389
It ain't right. You think it's right?

236
00:18:14.493 --> 00:18:18.327
Shut up for just a minute.
I'm trying to concentrate on this shit here.

237
00:18:24.402 --> 00:18:25.733
Nice truck.

238
00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:34.204
No? Makes your breath minty fresh.

239
00:18:34.312 --> 00:18:37.304
Is you all gonna arrest me?
Then go the fuck ahead and arrest me.

240
00:18:37.415 --> 00:18:38.473
If not, shut the fuck up.

241
00:18:38.583 --> 00:18:40.175
-You want to get arrested?
-No.

242
00:18:40.285 --> 00:18:43.083
-Shut the fuck up your own self.
-I'm out of here.

243
00:18:44.022 --> 00:18:47.048
Hey, D'Angelo.
You better bend the fuck over.

244
00:18:47.959 --> 00:18:49.017
Shit.

245
00:18:50.395 --> 00:18:53.990
-You ain't got nothing else to do today?
-No, no, nothing.

246
00:18:55.066 --> 00:18:57.159
Y'all ain't got no charge.

247
00:19:00.272 --> 00:19:03.833
You're getting awfully close, man.
You new on the force or some shit?

248
00:19:15.787 --> 00:19:17.277
All right, Dee.

249
00:19:44.416 --> 00:19:45.576
Move it.

250
00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.468
It's Greggs. Get me the lieutenant.

251
00:20:02.808 --> 00:20:05.072
Prez? He's no good to anyone, he's a goof.

252
00:20:05.177 --> 00:20:08.374
How is he my problem then?
How is he still carrying a gun and badge?

253
00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:10.641
You know Valchek in Southeast?

254
00:20:10.749 --> 00:20:12.740
-Yeah.
-Son-in-law.

255
00:20:13.585 --> 00:20:16.679
I can't carry him on this.
You know who Special sent me?

256
00:20:16.788 --> 00:20:18.619
-Who?
-Polk and Mahoney.

257
00:20:19.024 --> 00:20:21.584
Between the two of them
I don't have a designated driver.

258
00:20:21.693 --> 00:20:23.388
I heard you have someone from Pawnshop.

259
00:20:23.495 --> 00:20:25.895
Lester Freamon? A cuddly housecat.

260
00:20:26.164 --> 00:20:28.826
I don't think he can even find his gun.

261
00:20:30.135 --> 00:20:32.467
Look, take Pryzbylewski back.

262
00:20:32.571 --> 00:20:36.098
You know I can't. I would, but I can't.
I gave Valchek my word on it, okay?

263
00:20:36.208 --> 00:20:38.733
I can't help it that Prez
is fucking the guy's daughter.

264
00:20:38.844 --> 00:20:42.507
-If not for that, he's gone, no question.
-So, you got suction with Valchek?

265
00:20:42.614 --> 00:20:45.481
If I cross him,
I'm fucked on the next round of promotions.

266
00:20:45.584 --> 00:20:48.883
For Christ's sake,
I'm with you on the short list for major.

267
00:20:48.987 --> 00:20:51.785
Valchek has suction
with the First District Democratic Club...

268
00:20:51.890 --> 00:20:55.826
and they got suction with the Mayor,
and I'm the runt without a tit here.

269
00:20:56.061 --> 00:20:57.619
I owe you, okay?

270
00:20:59.498 --> 00:21:01.557
-So, give me Sydnor.
-No way.

271
00:21:01.666 --> 00:21:03.065
Give me Sydnor and I'll keep Prez.

272
00:21:03.168 --> 00:21:04.999
He's my best man, you can't take him.

273
00:21:05.103 --> 00:21:08.163
-I'm taking your worst, remember?
-How about Steinman?

274
00:21:08.273 --> 00:21:11.709
I'm working drugs in West Baltimore,
I need a black guy for surveillance.

275
00:21:11.810 --> 00:21:13.277
I need Sydnor.

276
00:21:13.979 --> 00:21:17.437
-Jesus, know what Prez did this morning?
-Tell me.

277
00:21:17.616 --> 00:21:21.108
He put a bullet through a wall,
dry-firing in the detail office.

278
00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:22.544
Look, no promises.

279
00:21:22.654 --> 00:21:25.452
You give me Sydnor,
I'll carry Pryzbylewski as long as I can.

280
00:21:25.557 --> 00:21:28.424
Fine, Cedric, fuck, whatever. Jesus Christ.

281
00:21:35.467 --> 00:21:36.798
How did you handle the judge?

282
00:21:36.902 --> 00:21:39.871
I told him we were looking
closely at the situation.

283
00:21:39.971 --> 00:21:42.735
I asked him not to say anything publicly.

284
00:21:43.842 --> 00:21:46.606
So, then he's not gonna go public, right?

285
00:21:48.413 --> 00:21:49.937
Judge Phelan called this morning...

286
00:21:50.048 --> 00:21:53.211
crying about a witness
in his murder trial who was killed.

287
00:21:53.318 --> 00:21:55.548
Did the judge say where he heard it?

288
00:21:55.654 --> 00:21:58.054
He heard it from our man, McNulty.

289
00:21:58.356 --> 00:22:00.187
That's his pipeline on this crap.

290
00:22:00.292 --> 00:22:04.695
Pardon my French, but I got no problem
giving that asshole up at this point.

291
00:22:04.896 --> 00:22:07.797
-I don't need people I can't trust.
-Yeah, who does?

292
00:22:07.899 --> 00:22:11.062
The newspapers get hold of this,
it'll be a complete clusterfuck.

293
00:22:11.169 --> 00:22:14.434
Okay, so the thing to do
is reassure the judge...

294
00:22:14.639 --> 00:22:16.834
keep him off his damn soapbox.

295
00:22:17.342 --> 00:22:19.435
An arrest or two would help.

296
00:22:20.712 --> 00:22:22.339
What if it's true?

297
00:22:22.847 --> 00:22:25.509
What if Barksdale ordered the murder
of a state's witness?

298
00:22:25.617 --> 00:22:26.606
Are you serious?

299
00:22:26.718 --> 00:22:29.448
Why would anyone do that
after the witness testifies?

300
00:22:29.554 --> 00:22:32.489
-It has no effect on the case.
-Payback, plain and simple.

301
00:22:32.591 --> 00:22:34.183
Bullshit, plain and simple.

302
00:22:34.292 --> 00:22:37.227
Look, I know there could be
two dozen other reasons...

303
00:22:37.329 --> 00:22:39.559
for this man to be murdered, but what if--

304
00:22:39.664 --> 00:22:43.191
No money for pretrial.
No witness protection program.

305
00:22:43.802 --> 00:22:47.203
Look, this is a poor fucking city, gentlemen.

306
00:22:47.439 --> 00:22:51.535
The last thing we ever need to do
is to announce we lost a witness.

307
00:22:51.843 --> 00:22:54.505
I mean, it's hard enough
pushing felony casework...

308
00:22:54.613 --> 00:22:56.080
through that courthouse as it is.

309
00:22:56.181 --> 00:23:00.117
-You got to pull McNulty off this.
-Who caught the murder case?

310
00:23:00.218 --> 00:23:03.483
-Bunk Moreland, McNulty's partner.
-Then you'd have to pull him, too.

311
00:23:03.588 --> 00:23:08.048
No, we pull McNulty up,
the judge will bring the press into this.

312
00:23:08.159 --> 00:23:10.218
I can see that a mile away.

313
00:23:10.562 --> 00:23:14.396
No, we're gonna sit tight,
let McNulty take his best shot...

314
00:23:14.499 --> 00:23:17.059
and hope like hell he comes up short.

315
00:23:19.304 --> 00:23:22.535
How do you wanna handle this?
We got nothing on him.

316
00:23:22.641 --> 00:23:24.575
We try to front, he'll see right through us.

317
00:23:24.676 --> 00:23:26.644
He's scared though. Soft.

318
00:23:27.612 --> 00:23:29.239
Go with the deuce?

319
00:23:30.615 --> 00:23:31.946
Hold up, hold up.

320
00:23:38.490 --> 00:23:40.651
-He part of my case?
-No, sir.

321
00:23:40.925 --> 00:23:43.519
He's a potential suspect in my murder.

322
00:23:45.330 --> 00:23:47.594
Which might be part of my case.

323
00:23:50.468 --> 00:23:53.437
I could use some coffee.
You want some coffee?

324
00:23:58.243 --> 00:24:00.609
-I need a word with you.
-We're just about to go--

325
00:24:00.712 --> 00:24:01.736
Now.

326
00:24:04.683 --> 00:24:07.982
You remember all that bullshit I gave you
about keeping me informed...

327
00:24:08.086 --> 00:24:10.646
about nothing happening
that I don't know about?

328
00:24:10.755 --> 00:24:12.052
-Lieutenant--
-Wasn't bullshit.

329
00:24:12.157 --> 00:24:15.615
My partner caught a murder.
It may have nothing with Barksdale at all.

330
00:24:15.727 --> 00:24:17.627
I just came from Deputy Ops' office...

331
00:24:17.729 --> 00:24:20.254
where your own major's
telling Burrell to do you.

332
00:24:20.365 --> 00:24:22.731
You hear me? Rawls is giving you up.

333
00:24:22.834 --> 00:24:26.099
-What the fuck did I do?
-You can't shut your mouth.

334
00:24:26.671 --> 00:24:30.038
You think that downtown judge
is gonna bail your ass out on this?

335
00:24:30.141 --> 00:24:33.304
You really think that?
You should have come to me.

336
00:24:33.478 --> 00:24:36.208
We bring this business to the deputy first,
we got a shot.

337
00:24:36.314 --> 00:24:38.680
But no, you're out there all alone,
jumping bad.

338
00:24:38.783 --> 00:24:40.944
-You got the deputy's ear?
-On this case, I do.

339
00:24:41.052 --> 00:24:43.850
Then how come they sent
every worthless hump in plainclothes?

340
00:24:43.955 --> 00:24:47.186
You ask for men,
they send you drunks and fuck-ups.

341
00:24:49.461 --> 00:24:51.292
I want to do this case.

342
00:24:51.429 --> 00:24:52.589
So do l.

343
00:24:52.697 --> 00:24:55.325
Then you're gonna get
all the way in, Lieutenant.

344
00:24:55.433 --> 00:24:59.836
If I see you get all the way in,
then I know who you are, what you're about.

345
00:24:59.938 --> 00:25:03.374
-Who is he?
-D'Angelo Barksdale.

346
00:25:03.608 --> 00:25:06.805
-Nephew to the king.
-That's the one that beat the murder?

347
00:25:06.911 --> 00:25:08.208
Yeah, him.

348
00:25:08.513 --> 00:25:10.879
What do you have
to connect him to the dead witness?

349
00:25:10.982 --> 00:25:13.974
-Not a thing.
-Why did you pick him up?

350
00:25:15.553 --> 00:25:18.317
Press him. See what kind of flex he shows.

351
00:25:20.091 --> 00:25:22.855
-She goes in with you.
-We don't need her.

352
00:25:23.194 --> 00:25:25.162
Bunk and me, we got our own rhythm.

353
00:25:25.263 --> 00:25:29.029
You want me in, McNulty?
I thought you said you wanted me in.

354
00:25:30.635 --> 00:25:35.265
You're along for this interview,
but it's Homicide's play, so let him lead.

355
00:25:40.011 --> 00:25:42.639
You might want to run
tag and title on these two trucks.

356
00:25:42.747 --> 00:25:46.012
-They scoped us when we jacked the kid.
-Been there.

357
00:25:46.818 --> 00:25:48.877
Info's already in the file.

358
00:25:49.387 --> 00:25:52.356
Y'all weren't the only lawmen
down in the Canyon today.

359
00:25:52.457 --> 00:25:55.517
-Really, where were you?
-Where was she?

360
00:26:02.367 --> 00:26:06.303
I mean, the thing is,
I can't see a reason for that man to be dead.

361
00:26:06.638 --> 00:26:09.505
I can't. I mean, hell, you beat us in court.

362
00:26:09.607 --> 00:26:11.575
-We don't take it personal.
-Fuck, no.

363
00:26:11.676 --> 00:26:15.442
We get paid either way.
And it's not like you did anything real bad...

364
00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:18.048
throwing a couple of hot ones
at Pooh Blanchard.

365
00:26:18.149 --> 00:26:20.083
No one's gonna miss that motherfucker.

366
00:26:20.185 --> 00:26:22.653
But you know the man
who got killed this time?

367
00:26:22.754 --> 00:26:24.881
You know who that
poor son of a bitch was?

368
00:26:24.989 --> 00:26:26.115
A citizen.

369
00:26:26.224 --> 00:26:29.455
Worked every goddamn day of his life.
You know that?

370
00:26:29.694 --> 00:26:33.255
He would get up every day,
go out and do maintenance work.

371
00:26:33.364 --> 00:26:36.162
Then on the weekends,
he was driving a cab out to the airport.

372
00:26:36.267 --> 00:26:37.495
Two jobs.

373
00:26:37.602 --> 00:26:40.400
And he volunteers what little time
he has left at his church.

374
00:26:40.505 --> 00:26:43.303
-Church-going man.
-A bethel man, a deacon.

375
00:26:43.942 --> 00:26:47.605
Two jobs and three kids.
Did you know that?

376
00:26:48.012 --> 00:26:50.242
Three kids. Young, too.

377
00:26:50.915 --> 00:26:53.577
Five, eight, eleven.

378
00:26:54.619 --> 00:26:56.917
Crying their little orphaned asses to sleep...

379
00:26:57.021 --> 00:26:59.319
'cause they lost their mama
some years ago...

380
00:26:59.424 --> 00:27:01.915
and now they out there on their own.

381
00:27:05.063 --> 00:27:08.328
-He doesn't believe us.
-I know he don't believe it.

382
00:27:08.533 --> 00:27:11.593
We've been here two hours,
telling you what's true in the world...

383
00:27:11.703 --> 00:27:13.364
and you sit like nothing happened.

384
00:27:13.471 --> 00:27:14.563
Where my lawyer at?

385
00:27:14.672 --> 00:27:16.833
We called him.
When he comes, we'll let you know.

386
00:27:16.941 --> 00:27:18.704
I got nothing to say.

387
00:27:18.843 --> 00:27:21.641
I mean, I'm sorry for the man,
but I ain't got nothing to say.

388
00:27:21.746 --> 00:27:25.375
You sorry? You sorry for him?
You fucking killed the man.

389
00:27:25.483 --> 00:27:27.212
-No.
-Yes, you did.

390
00:27:27.318 --> 00:27:30.913
We don't think that you shot him,
but if you weren't so busy...

391
00:27:31.022 --> 00:27:32.717
Iighting folks up in high-rise lobby...

392
00:27:32.824 --> 00:27:35.190
he ain't coming out of the elevator
and see it happen.

393
00:27:35.293 --> 00:27:37.090
He don't see anything, he doesn't testify.

394
00:27:37.195 --> 00:27:39.891
He doesn't testify,
those kids still got a daddy to lean on.

395
00:27:39.998 --> 00:27:41.727
-Why'd he testify?
-How would we know?

396
00:27:41.833 --> 00:27:45.098
-He didn't have to testify.
-No, he didn't, but he did.

397
00:27:45.203 --> 00:27:46.966
And you still beat the charge, didn't you?

398
00:27:47.071 --> 00:27:49.801
But that wasn't enough.
It's not enough to beat the murder.

399
00:27:49.908 --> 00:27:52.536
They gotta send a cold message
to everyone in the Terrace.

400
00:27:52.644 --> 00:27:56.307
Fuck the working man.
Fuck his kids, that shit don't count.

401
00:27:58.816 --> 00:28:01.376
See, that's what I don't get
about the drug thing.

402
00:28:01.486 --> 00:28:05.013
Why can't you sell the shit
and walk the fuck away?

403
00:28:05.390 --> 00:28:08.689
You know what I mean?
Everything else in this country gets sold...

404
00:28:08.793 --> 00:28:10.988
without people shooting each other
behind it.

405
00:28:11.095 --> 00:28:13.996
In the Terrace, it's one body after another.

406
00:28:14.499 --> 00:28:16.467
You remember that little boy...

407
00:28:16.668 --> 00:28:20.331
got shot in the barbershop
on West Lombard last summer?

408
00:28:21.506 --> 00:28:24.634
One asshole chases another into a house...

409
00:28:24.742 --> 00:28:26.334
empties a 9.

410
00:28:26.444 --> 00:28:29.345
Bullshit argument over 20 missing gelcaps...

411
00:28:30.448 --> 00:28:33.144
and that little kid,
instead of getting his first haircut...

412
00:28:33.251 --> 00:28:35.048
he gets one in the eye.

413
00:28:35.653 --> 00:28:37.143
You remember that?

414
00:28:37.388 --> 00:28:39.324
-It's fucked up.
-Yes, it is.

415
00:28:39.324 --> 00:28:40.154
-It's fucked up.
-Yes, it is.

416
00:28:42.460 --> 00:28:44.519
They didn't have to do that.

417
00:28:44.629 --> 00:28:46.563
Shoot up a barber shop?

418
00:28:46.931 --> 00:28:49.331
No, they did not have to do that.

419
00:28:52.003 --> 00:28:53.800
That man was just...

420
00:28:56.341 --> 00:28:57.603
my thing.

421
00:28:59.644 --> 00:29:01.771
My thing, they ain't had....

422
00:29:04.115 --> 00:29:06.106
They ain't had to do that.

423
00:29:15.326 --> 00:29:17.191
No mama and no daddy.

424
00:29:18.262 --> 00:29:19.627
Lord Jesus!

425
00:29:24.636 --> 00:29:27.969
I'll tell you what I think
you should do, D'Angelo...

426
00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:31.404
not because I think you wanted that man
to get shot...

427
00:29:31.509 --> 00:29:34.034
or had anything to do with shooting him.

428
00:29:34.145 --> 00:29:37.512
But I think you could just sit here...

429
00:29:37.782 --> 00:29:39.841
for a moment or two,
collect your thoughts...

430
00:29:39.951 --> 00:29:42.317
you know, get your shit together.

431
00:29:42.954 --> 00:29:44.922
And then I think it might be a good thing...

432
00:29:45.023 --> 00:29:48.356
for you to write a little letter
to those children...

433
00:29:48.459 --> 00:29:51.121
and you let them know you're sorry...

434
00:29:52.697 --> 00:29:55.860
that they're not gonna
have anyone left, you know?

435
00:29:57.335 --> 00:29:59.269
I mean, just say something.

436
00:29:59.370 --> 00:30:02.464
Tell them how you personally
think your uncle...

437
00:30:02.573 --> 00:30:05.667
maybe he got it wrong this time,
because it's wrong...

438
00:30:05.777 --> 00:30:09.406
that they lost their daddy
behind what happened, you know?

439
00:30:11.816 --> 00:30:15.684
It might mean something to them to know
that you're feeling for them.

440
00:30:22.527 --> 00:30:24.859
Man, I ain't got nothing to say.

441
00:30:26.297 --> 00:30:28.492
Just say what's in your heart.

442
00:30:50.054 --> 00:30:52.522
Church deacon? That was thick.

443
00:30:52.623 --> 00:30:54.887
Got good to me, what can I say?

444
00:30:55.526 --> 00:30:58.757
It's sad enough with the kids
being orphaned and everything.

445
00:30:59.197 --> 00:31:01.324
Photo was from Bunk's desk.

446
00:31:03.201 --> 00:31:05.999
-They're yours?
-Yeah, afraid so.

447
00:31:07.238 --> 00:31:09.832
Good thing they look like their mama.

448
00:31:10.007 --> 00:31:13.636
Maurice Levy just posted.
He's by the elevators.

449
00:31:21.886 --> 00:31:24.116
-The defense never rests.
-Shame on you, McNulty.

450
00:31:24.222 --> 00:31:27.089
Dragging me from the Levy family preserve
on a Friday night.

451
00:31:27.191 --> 00:31:29.682
-My apologies.
-Yvette made brisket.

452
00:31:29.794 --> 00:31:32.262
-Good?
-When served hot. One or two?

453
00:31:32.864 --> 00:31:34.092
Your client.

454
00:31:34.599 --> 00:31:37.067
What the fuck! Stop writing! Now!

455
00:31:37.168 --> 00:31:38.863
-I'm just--
-Shut up!

456
00:31:39.570 --> 00:31:42.733
He calls his lawyer, that's supposed to be
the end of the interview.

457
00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:45.206
Your client gave no statement,
we took no statement.

458
00:31:45.309 --> 00:31:49.109
He just decided, voluntarily,
to write a letter to the victim's family.

459
00:31:49.213 --> 00:31:51.477
-To say that--
-Shut up!

460
00:31:53.351 --> 00:31:55.876
-Any charge here?
-No charge.

461
00:31:55.987 --> 00:31:59.582
Good, get up. Go! Walk!

462
00:32:02.226 --> 00:32:04.387
Listen to me, you don't say anything...

463
00:32:04.495 --> 00:32:07.020
you don't do anything,
you don't write anything.

464
00:32:07.131 --> 00:32:08.189
Do you hear me?

465
00:32:08.299 --> 00:32:09.493
Shut up!

466
00:32:09.634 --> 00:32:13.730
How many times do I have to tell you people
the same fucking thing?

467
00:32:28.452 --> 00:32:30.079
What the fuck is that?

468
00:32:33.024 --> 00:32:37.017
Armoire. Louis Quatorze.

469
00:32:38.429 --> 00:32:40.454
I mean, what is it, a toy?

470
00:32:42.233 --> 00:32:45.361
Some of you I know.
Some of you I will know.

471
00:32:45.703 --> 00:32:49.139
If you've ever worked with me before,
you know I don't want cowboy shit...

472
00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:51.003
and I don't want surprises.

473
00:32:51.409 --> 00:32:52.842
The task...

474
00:32:56.514 --> 00:33:00.245
is Avon Barksdale,
and Avon Barksdale only.

475
00:33:00.818 --> 00:33:02.786
No sidetrips, no sprawl.

476
00:33:04.088 --> 00:33:07.785
Primary investigators
are Greggs from my unit and--

477
00:33:11.295 --> 00:33:14.458
Greggs from my unit
and McNulty from Homicide.

478
00:33:14.799 --> 00:33:18.565
They keep the file.
On the street, we work partners.

479
00:33:19.503 --> 00:33:22.131
Greggs and Sydnor. Herc and Carver.

480
00:33:22.540 --> 00:33:25.805
McNulty's with Santangelo,
Mahone and Polk.

481
00:33:26.143 --> 00:33:28.111
Pryzbylewski and Freamon.

482
00:33:28.679 --> 00:33:30.579
To start with, we got nine--

483
00:33:30.681 --> 00:33:33.081
How's that? Did that get it?

484
00:33:33.484 --> 00:33:36.453
What? Do you hear me?

485
00:33:37.121 --> 00:33:38.247
What?

486
00:33:40.591 --> 00:33:43.253
To start with, we have
nine or ten open homicide files...

487
00:33:43.361 --> 00:33:45.488
to work back through for leads.

488
00:33:45.696 --> 00:33:48.494
McNulty and Santangelo,
they're on that already.

489
00:33:48.599 --> 00:33:52.592
Herc, Carver, Sydnor, and me,
we'll be targeting street dealers...

490
00:33:52.703 --> 00:33:55.263
and rolling them back up
at Barksdale's people.

491
00:33:55.373 --> 00:33:58.536
Polk and Mahone are available
to run down specific leads.

492
00:33:58.643 --> 00:34:01.043
Freamon, Pryzbylewski,
are gonna start in-office...

493
00:34:01.145 --> 00:34:02.544
on clerical duty.

494
00:34:02.647 --> 00:34:06.083
-You need a prosecutor--
-No, turn the shit off!

495
00:34:06.717 --> 00:34:07.877
What?

496
00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:10.951
You need a prosecutor.

497
00:34:11.055 --> 00:34:13.785
Rhonda Pearlman from Narcotics
is assigned.

498
00:34:14.992 --> 00:34:18.189
Now, we don't have enough desks yet,
so we gotta share--

499
00:34:18.296 --> 00:34:20.696
-Y'all from Purchasing?
-No.

500
00:34:26.938 --> 00:34:29.532
Like I was saying, we've been promised
some computers...

501
00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:31.471
and surveillance equipment.

502
00:34:31.575 --> 00:34:35.511
-Questions?
-Yeah, who signs the overtime slips?

503
00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:38.410
No OT, unless prior authorization.

504
00:34:38.516 --> 00:34:42.145
A case goes from red to black
by way of green, Lieutenant.

505
00:34:42.653 --> 00:34:45.178
You people bring me
something that needs OT...

506
00:34:45.289 --> 00:34:46.847
you'll get OT...

507
00:34:46.958 --> 00:34:50.450
until then, live on your fucking salaries.

508
00:35:02.707 --> 00:35:07.144
"I'm very sorry for your father.
If I could've stopped it, I would have."

509
00:35:08.379 --> 00:35:10.074
What can you do with this?

510
00:35:10.181 --> 00:35:11.614
Nothing legally.

511
00:35:11.716 --> 00:35:15.277
He doesn't put himself in,
or anyone else for that matter.

512
00:35:15.653 --> 00:35:17.314
You can't read that letter...

513
00:35:17.421 --> 00:35:19.753
and think that man was killed
for any other reason...

514
00:35:19.857 --> 00:35:20.983
than he was a witness.

515
00:35:21.092 --> 00:35:24.493
Why apologize at all
if you got nothing to do with it?

516
00:35:30.468 --> 00:35:32.493
We lost a state's witness.

517
00:35:32.737 --> 00:35:36.036
Even in Baltimore,
that's supposed to mean something, right?

518
00:35:36.140 --> 00:35:38.370
Just go to the deputy,
show him what's what...

519
00:35:38.476 --> 00:35:40.341
and let's put something real together.

520
00:35:40.444 --> 00:35:43.971
This case needs informants.
It needs long-term surveillance.

521
00:35:44.081 --> 00:35:46.481
And eventually,
it's gonna need a Title 3 wiretap.

522
00:35:46.584 --> 00:35:50.452
Most of all, it needs police who know
how to work those things.

523
00:35:51.222 --> 00:35:54.055
You think it's good for business
to put it out on the street...

524
00:35:54.158 --> 00:35:55.352
that our witnesses get killed?

525
00:35:55.459 --> 00:35:57.927
You think it's not on the street already?

526
00:36:00.664 --> 00:36:02.632
No grandstanding, no red balls.

527
00:36:02.733 --> 00:36:05.463
Like I said, we get in and out.

528
00:36:22.553 --> 00:36:23.815
Aunt June.

529
00:36:26.490 --> 00:36:29.357
Yeah, I hope you're hungry.

530
00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:30.688
Starving.

531
00:36:31.395 --> 00:36:32.657
Hey, Dee!

532
00:36:34.031 --> 00:36:35.225
What's up, baby?

533
00:36:35.332 --> 00:36:37.323
-That your uncle?
-Yeah.

534
00:36:38.102 --> 00:36:39.763
I thought he'd look different.

535
00:36:39.870 --> 00:36:42.839
My man, Dee. What's up, man?

536
00:36:42.940 --> 00:36:44.703
This the little man?

537
00:36:45.176 --> 00:36:48.634
Yo, you see how shorty
favor your nephew here?

538
00:36:49.513 --> 00:36:52.607
What's up, little man?
You ain't gonna be able to deny that child.

539
00:36:52.716 --> 00:36:56.652
You wanna come to me?
I know you tryin' to come to me.

540
00:36:56.754 --> 00:36:58.517
-Been napping.
-Yeah?

541
00:36:58.622 --> 00:36:59.680
Just woke up.

542
00:36:59.790 --> 00:37:01.690
You got a grip, let me see your grip.

543
00:37:01.792 --> 00:37:04.226
C'mon, give us a twirl, let's take a look.

544
00:37:06.697 --> 00:37:07.891
What you looking at?

545
00:37:07.998 --> 00:37:09.932
-Go fix her a hot plate.
-All right.

546
00:37:10.034 --> 00:37:12.730
Put everything on it.
She's the skinniest thing in here.

547
00:37:12.837 --> 00:37:14.395
Come on, girl, we gonna hook you up.

548
00:37:14.505 --> 00:37:16.666
Don't let that fool you, she can eat, man.

549
00:37:16.774 --> 00:37:20.642
-How y'all doing? You doing good?
-Yeah, we all right.

550
00:37:20.744 --> 00:37:23.713
She want me to move in,
I'm thinking about it.

551
00:37:24.381 --> 00:37:25.149
Let's walk.

552
00:37:25.149 --> 00:37:25.706
Let's walk.

553
00:37:27.852 --> 00:37:30.286
Here you come.
You gonna take my man from me?

554
00:37:30.387 --> 00:37:31.445
Yeah.

555
00:37:32.423 --> 00:37:34.220
Be careful with my little soldier.

556
00:37:35.025 --> 00:37:37.289
-Got a name for that one?
-No.

557
00:37:37.928 --> 00:37:41.159
But he's one of the boys
they use in the stairwell.

558
00:37:41.265 --> 00:37:43.733
-What about him?
-That's Little Man.

559
00:37:44.468 --> 00:37:45.833
He's muscle.

560
00:37:46.170 --> 00:37:48.070
You know his real name?

561
00:37:50.474 --> 00:37:52.908
-Cl?
-Yeah.

562
00:37:53.344 --> 00:37:56.245
-You need some privacy?
-No, it's all right.

563
00:37:57.481 --> 00:37:58.778
He's cool.

564
00:38:01.051 --> 00:38:02.814
What's with the hat?

565
00:38:03.154 --> 00:38:05.145
Go ahead, tell him, Bubbles.

566
00:38:06.390 --> 00:38:09.553
I go down the way
with some hats that I'm selling.

567
00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:12.094
If someone is someone you need to know...

568
00:38:12.196 --> 00:38:15.393
I put the red hat on them
and Kima here take the pictures.

569
00:38:15.599 --> 00:38:17.499
If they in the mix, they get another color.

570
00:38:17.601 --> 00:38:19.296
If they ain't shit, they don't get shit.

571
00:38:19.403 --> 00:38:21.803
Everyone in the hat's
part of Barksdale's crew?

572
00:38:21.906 --> 00:38:23.396
At the Terrace.

573
00:38:23.774 --> 00:38:26.106
We haven't hit the low-rises yet.

574
00:38:27.144 --> 00:38:28.543
That's sharp.

575
00:38:28.913 --> 00:38:30.175
I like that.

576
00:38:30.281 --> 00:38:31.976
Bubbles does not forget a face.

577
00:38:32.082 --> 00:38:35.381
Ain't so good with names,
but, you know, faces I keep in my head.

578
00:38:35.486 --> 00:38:39.183
I used to take him down to Escape Unit,
let him look through the warrant books.

579
00:38:39.290 --> 00:38:43.659
He'd call me up that night,
telling me to go to this corner, that corner.

580
00:38:44.795 --> 00:38:46.592
Yeah, paid $25 a pop.

581
00:38:47.231 --> 00:38:49.222
-That's good money.
-Yeah.

582
00:38:49.767 --> 00:38:52.167
How much does the hat routine pay?

583
00:38:52.703 --> 00:38:53.897
Nothing.

584
00:38:54.438 --> 00:38:56.030
We free on this.

585
00:38:58.275 --> 00:39:01.506
-Motherfuckers beat my boy down.
-Who?

586
00:39:01.612 --> 00:39:03.910
Little hoppers in the low-rises.

587
00:39:04.014 --> 00:39:05.447
Who's your boy?

588
00:39:05.549 --> 00:39:07.073
I got a friend.

589
00:39:08.385 --> 00:39:09.613
Younger white boy.

590
00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:12.382
Used to come down to the corners,
real green.

591
00:39:12.489 --> 00:39:14.354
I was schooling him, you know?

592
00:39:14.458 --> 00:39:15.925
What happened?

593
00:39:17.394 --> 00:39:20.158
-They stomped him.
-You see it?

594
00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:26.601
Fuck a man like that up
for a couple dollars, you know?

595
00:39:26.704 --> 00:39:29.537
He still at University,
tubes all up in his nose.

596
00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:32.131
Can't say but a fucking word or two.

597
00:39:33.844 --> 00:39:36.506
But you know, that's how it goes, right?

598
00:39:37.414 --> 00:39:39.279
How you feeling, Bubbles?

599
00:39:40.084 --> 00:39:41.346
Restless.

600
00:39:43.487 --> 00:39:45.182
Yeah, I could tell.

601
00:39:45.489 --> 00:39:46.547
What the fuck?

602
00:39:46.657 --> 00:39:49.182
Can you hook a nigger up with
$10 then till tomorrow?

603
00:39:49.293 --> 00:39:52.057
I mean, you know, just to carry me, Kima.

604
00:39:58.335 --> 00:39:59.427
Bubbles.

605
00:40:01.805 --> 00:40:03.067
Obliged.

606
00:40:05.009 --> 00:40:07.443
Stay out of the projects
the next couple of days...

607
00:40:07.544 --> 00:40:08.772
just to be safe.

608
00:40:08.879 --> 00:40:11.143
Girl's always fretting over me.

609
00:40:12.683 --> 00:40:14.742
-Change it up, Bubs.
-Yeah, yeah.

610
00:40:14.852 --> 00:40:16.251
Go Eastside.

611
00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:17.851
Yeah, yeah.

612
00:40:20.190 --> 00:40:21.157
$20?

613
00:40:21.659 --> 00:40:25.595
-You gonna spoil him with that shit.
-I respect the work.

614
00:40:28.132 --> 00:40:32.228
They used your name, Stringer, Wee-Bey...

615
00:40:32.736 --> 00:40:34.601
Savino, Peanut....

616
00:40:35.739 --> 00:40:38.333
They knew a lot of names. They knew a lot.

617
00:40:38.442 --> 00:40:40.433
But you didn't say nothing?

618
00:40:41.378 --> 00:40:43.676
Shit, man, I don't know nothing.

619
00:40:44.148 --> 00:40:46.139
What was you writing then?

620
00:40:47.251 --> 00:40:49.685
Yo, they was talking about
the man who got killed...

621
00:40:49.787 --> 00:40:51.379
and his kids, they asked me to write.

622
00:40:51.488 --> 00:40:54.616
-What you got to do with them, Dee?
-Yeah, that's what I said.

623
00:40:54.725 --> 00:40:57.250
Then they cried
about how the kids ain't doing so good.

624
00:40:57.361 --> 00:41:00.762
I'm like, it ain't gonna hurt for me
to say I'm sorry the man got killed.

625
00:41:00.864 --> 00:41:03.264
Why the fuck you gotta say you're sorry?

626
00:41:03.367 --> 00:41:05.835
Motherfuckers tried to
put your ass in the stir.

627
00:41:05.936 --> 00:41:08.131
Yeah, but it didn't turn out that way.

628
00:41:08.238 --> 00:41:11.537
You know, that's what I'm saying,
it's a shame that y'all....

629
00:41:13.777 --> 00:41:17.975
I'm saying, it's a shame
what happened to that man, all right?

630
00:41:18.082 --> 00:41:20.607
'Cause he didn't do anything
but come off the elevator...

631
00:41:20.718 --> 00:41:23.619
when I was doing that thing
that I was doing.

632
00:41:24.722 --> 00:41:27.054
What you think, cuz?

633
00:41:28.092 --> 00:41:29.252
About what?

634
00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:31.988
I'm saying, what you think
about what happened to the man?

635
00:41:32.096 --> 00:41:34.530
You think we killed the motherfucker?

636
00:41:36.467 --> 00:41:38.025
Speak your mind.

637
00:41:41.205 --> 00:41:43.730
-Man, I don't know.
-Exactly.

638
00:41:44.074 --> 00:41:45.974
You don't know,
and you don't need to know.

639
00:41:46.076 --> 00:41:49.443
And if we did, we had a reason.
And if we didn't, we had a reason.

640
00:41:49.546 --> 00:41:52.413
But either way,
you ain't got shit to do with it.

641
00:41:52.716 --> 00:41:54.513
It ain't on you, cuz.

642
00:41:55.119 --> 00:41:57.280
You feel me? It ain't on you.

643
00:41:58.255 --> 00:42:00.519
Now, if you get jacked again...

644
00:42:00.624 --> 00:42:03.855
I don't want to hear shit about
you writing nothing to no one.

645
00:42:03.961 --> 00:42:05.929
-Got it?
-Yeah.

646
00:42:08.065 --> 00:42:09.999
Come on, let's have some good times...

647
00:42:10.100 --> 00:42:13.558
and get some ribs
before they done ate all the ribs up.

648
00:42:15.572 --> 00:42:18.268
-This case isn't shit, Carv.
-I know it.

649
00:42:18.375 --> 00:42:22.038
We're dancing around
with this motherfucker, typing shit out...

650
00:42:22.146 --> 00:42:24.376
taking pictures of assholes in hats.

651
00:42:24.481 --> 00:42:26.642
-What the fuck is that?
-It's bullshit.

652
00:42:26.750 --> 00:42:29.617
I say we go down there right now.
Right fucking now.

653
00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:32.314
We go into those towers,
and we let them know.

654
00:42:33.891 --> 00:42:35.188
I'm serious.

655
00:42:35.292 --> 00:42:38.523
You got to let these motherfuckers know
who you are.

656
00:42:39.663 --> 00:42:41.028
You coming?

657
00:42:42.699 --> 00:42:44.894
-I'm with you.
-Carv?

658
00:42:47.638 --> 00:42:49.128
What the hell?

659
00:42:49.873 --> 00:42:51.238
Let's do it.

660
00:42:56.647 --> 00:42:57.841
Come on.

661
00:43:10.761 --> 00:43:13.559
Shut it down. Five-O.

662
00:43:15.032 --> 00:43:17.159
Five-O, five-O, break out.

663
00:43:36.220 --> 00:43:38.552
Yo, come here, man.
Come here, where you going?

664
00:43:38.655 --> 00:43:40.919
Don't act like you don't know me.
Get your hands up.

665
00:43:41.024 --> 00:43:42.457
Put that down.

666
00:43:42.559 --> 00:43:46.256
-Drop that shit! Kiss the fucking ground!
-Put your hands up.

667
00:43:47.231 --> 00:43:49.529
Don't look at me like I ain't talking English.

668
00:43:49.633 --> 00:43:53.296
You got a needle on you?
Got anything in here that's gonna stick me?

669
00:43:53.537 --> 00:43:56.097
No? What's that?

670
00:43:57.040 --> 00:43:58.598
What you got in your pockets?

671
00:43:58.709 --> 00:44:00.870
You know what?
Put your pants down, man.

672
00:44:00.978 --> 00:44:03.003
Put your pants down
and get down on the ground.

673
00:44:03.113 --> 00:44:05.411
Get down on the fucking ground!

674
00:44:07.451 --> 00:44:09.749
All right, spread your shit out.

675
00:44:10.354 --> 00:44:12.754
Nice shoes. Think a happy thought.

676
00:44:15.859 --> 00:44:19.090
Why don't you go somewhere else
with that bullshit?

677
00:44:21.431 --> 00:44:22.796
No-good motherfuckers.

678
00:44:22.900 --> 00:44:25.198
Stay down, man, stay down.

679
00:44:25.302 --> 00:44:28.237
Y'all can let Barksdale and them know
who owns these towers.

680
00:44:28.338 --> 00:44:29.737
'Cause we're coming back.

681
00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:31.740
-I'm sick of this shit.
-Kiss my ass!

682
00:44:31.842 --> 00:44:34.538
We roll out, come back in an hour,
catch everybody dirty.

683
00:44:34.645 --> 00:44:35.737
You'll see how that goes.

684
00:44:35.846 --> 00:44:38.110
-That's bullshit, man.
-Yo, stay down, man.

685
00:44:38.215 --> 00:44:41.275
That's fucked up. Man ain't did nothing.

686
00:44:42.553 --> 00:44:44.077
Want something?

687
00:44:49.059 --> 00:44:51.960
-Move, shitbird.
-I ain't doing nothing.

688
00:44:54.431 --> 00:44:57.059
Really? I got nothing for you.

689
00:44:59.469 --> 00:45:03.064
-My eye, my eye.
-Who you gonna eyefuck now?

690
00:45:05.509 --> 00:45:07.033
Are you serious?

691
00:45:07.144 --> 00:45:09.442
You bleed on my car?
Don't bleed on my car.

692
00:45:09.546 --> 00:45:11.480
Get your shit off my car.

693
00:45:17.955 --> 00:45:20.219
What the fuck's the matter with you?

694
00:45:40.711 --> 00:45:42.144
Got a visual?

695
00:45:43.580 --> 00:45:44.604
Fuck.

696
00:45:45.215 --> 00:45:46.705
Get the radio.

697
00:45:48.051 --> 00:45:51.020
1 1 :35, Signal 13.

698
00:45:51.488 --> 00:45:53.752
771 Franklin, in the Court.

699
00:45:54.358 --> 00:45:55.586
Son of a bitch!

700
00:45:55.692 --> 00:45:58.684
Shots fired, shots fired.
Officers need assistance.

701
00:46:00.263 --> 00:46:02.026
I'm hit! Signal 13.

702
00:46:02.132 --> 00:46:04.225
Officer down, Officer down!

703
00:46:11.808 --> 00:46:12.866
Shit!

704
00:46:33.563 --> 00:46:35.997
-Hello?
-You seen the paper?

705
00:46:36.333 --> 00:46:39.063
-What?
-The newspaper, get it.

706
00:46:56.887 --> 00:46:58.286
Hey, kids.

707
00:47:20.177 --> 00:47:21.735
Oh, no.

708
00:47:23.580 --> 00:47:24.774
You happy now, bitch?

709
00:47:27.651 --> 00:47:28.879
McNulty!

710
00:47:30.153 --> 00:47:31.745
Where in fuck is he?

711
00:47:31.855 --> 00:47:35.552
He's detailed, Major, to Narcotics--

712
00:47:35.659 --> 00:47:39.060
I fucking know where he's detailed.
I fucking already know that!

713
00:47:39.162 --> 00:47:40.129
Yes, sir.

714
00:47:40.230 --> 00:47:43.131
-Where is he right now?
-I can page him, sir.

715
00:47:47.571 --> 00:47:49.596
Move that fucking desk out of my unit.

716
00:47:49.706 --> 00:47:52.573
I do not want that
fucking man's desk in my unit.

717
00:47:52.676 --> 00:47:54.803
That's Crutchfield's desk.

718
00:47:57.180 --> 00:47:58.704
Crutchfield's?

719
00:47:59.149 --> 00:48:00.776
McNulty sits here.

720
00:48:07.858 --> 00:48:11.316
-What the fuck was that about?
-Did you see today's paper?

721
00:48:11.428 --> 00:48:14.488
-Just sports.
-You gotta check out the front page.

722
00:48:20.537 --> 00:48:23.700
-What do you think they'll do to him?
-Let me tell you something.

723
00:48:23.807 --> 00:48:27.436
If he gets caught with his dick up the ass
of the deputy's wife...

724
00:48:27.544 --> 00:48:32.379
he's still gonna have more of a career
than if they find out he's behind that story.

725
00:48:53.904 --> 00:48:55.269
Lieutenant.

726
00:48:56.540 --> 00:49:00.977
I saw the story in the paper.
I want you to know I had nothing to do....

727
00:49:21.464 --> 00:49:24.160
-They jumped us, Boss.
-Who?

728
00:49:25.202 --> 00:49:26.669
Fucking project niggers.

729
00:49:26.770 --> 00:49:29.762
What are you doing here
at 2:00 in the morning?

730
00:49:31.107 --> 00:49:33.337
Field interviews, sir, police work.

731
00:49:33.443 --> 00:49:35.502
-Police work?
-Yeah.

732
00:49:38.014 --> 00:49:42.212
I got a 14-year-old in critical
but stable condition at University...

733
00:49:42.319 --> 00:49:44.378
and two witnesses who say
one of you princes...

734
00:49:44.487 --> 00:49:46.455
cold-cocked him
with the butt-end of a pistol.

735
00:49:46.556 --> 00:49:48.387
-No, sir.
-I got his mother over at lID...

736
00:49:48.491 --> 00:49:50.550
filing a formal brutality charge...

737
00:49:50.660 --> 00:49:53.356
which for Herc will make an even four
in the last two years.

738
00:49:53.463 --> 00:49:55.363
-None sustained.
-But all of them true.

739
00:49:55.465 --> 00:49:56.523
We thought that--

740
00:49:56.633 --> 00:49:59.193
I got one less Crown Vic
than I had last night.

741
00:49:59.302 --> 00:50:01.770
I'm out two Kevlar vests
that burned in the car...

742
00:50:01.872 --> 00:50:04.238
two hand-held radios, a shotgun...

743
00:50:04.341 --> 00:50:07.777
and I'm about to lose this idiot here
for a week or two of medical.

744
00:50:07.878 --> 00:50:09.311
And for what?

745
00:50:09.980 --> 00:50:12.608
What did you all learn
when you went to the Terrace...

746
00:50:12.716 --> 00:50:15.241
at 2:00 in the morning
to conduct field interviews?

747
00:50:15.352 --> 00:50:19.118
What valuable information did
we acquire from this situation?

748
00:50:21.992 --> 00:50:25.291
IID is gonna be on all three of you
by afternoon...

749
00:50:25.929 --> 00:50:28.363
and if you don't get a story straight
by then...

750
00:50:28.465 --> 00:50:32.834
you're gonna have a file thick enough
to see the light of a trial board.

751
00:50:34.004 --> 00:50:37.701
Now tell me, who cold-cocked the kid?

752
00:50:46.583 --> 00:50:47.641
Me.

753
00:50:51.221 --> 00:50:52.279
Why?

754
00:50:54.357 --> 00:50:55.984
He pissed me off.

755
00:50:59.396 --> 00:51:02.593
No, Officer Pryzbylewski,
he did not piss you off.

756
00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:08.130
He made you fear for your safety
and that of your fellow officers.

757
00:51:09.205 --> 00:51:11.264
I'm guessing now, but maybe...

758
00:51:11.374 --> 00:51:14.639
he was seen to pick up a bottle
and menace officers Hauk and Carver...

759
00:51:14.744 --> 00:51:17.975
both of whom had already sustained injury
from flying projectiles.

760
00:51:18.081 --> 00:51:20.641
Rather than use deadly force
in such a situation...

761
00:51:20.750 --> 00:51:25.153
maybe you elected to approach the youth,
ordering him to drop the bottle.

762
00:51:25.455 --> 00:51:28.083
Maybe when he raised the bottle
in a threatening manner...

763
00:51:28.191 --> 00:51:31.592
you used a Kel-Light,
not the handle of your service weapon...

764
00:51:31.695 --> 00:51:33.822
to incapacitate the suspect.

765
00:51:36.166 --> 00:51:37.565
Go practice.

766
00:51:38.335 --> 00:51:41.133
You fuck the bullshit up
when you talk to lnternal...

767
00:51:41.237 --> 00:51:43.797
I can't fix it, you're on your own.

768
00:51:52.382 --> 00:51:55.545
-Push the arraignments back to 3:00.
-And the Gillette case?

769
00:51:55.652 --> 00:51:58.678
The Gillette trial goes back
on the move docket.

770
00:51:58.788 --> 00:52:01.382
Come on, walk with me. I'm running late.

771
00:52:03.793 --> 00:52:05.988
-It wasn't me.
-The story quoted you.

772
00:52:06.096 --> 00:52:09.156
Reporter has the story confirmed
when he calls me about the quote.

773
00:52:09.265 --> 00:52:10.493
What am I gonna say?

774
00:52:10.600 --> 00:52:14.366
No, he wasn't a witness?
No, he didn't testify in my court last week?

775
00:52:14.471 --> 00:52:15.597
What?

776
00:52:15.872 --> 00:52:17.999
You don't think it's around
about the witness?

777
00:52:18.108 --> 00:52:21.043
Lawyers, clerks, jurors, everybody talks.

778
00:52:21.144 --> 00:52:24.636
-I'm in the shit here, Your Honor.
-What can I tell you?

779
00:52:24.748 --> 00:52:28.081
I called the deputy, not the newspapers.
I gotta run.

780
00:52:32.789 --> 00:52:36.316
-You should have hung them.
-If I hang them, I hang myself.

781
00:52:36.860 --> 00:52:38.851
I'm the man in charge, remember?

782
00:52:38.962 --> 00:52:41.954
Besides, you don't
give your people up to lID.

783
00:52:42.232 --> 00:52:43.893
You don't do that.

784
00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:47.333
Even if they put
a 14-year-old kid into Critical Care?

785
00:52:51.441 --> 00:52:53.409
This case, it's just....

786
00:52:54.077 --> 00:52:55.544
Get out of it.

787
00:52:56.679 --> 00:52:59.011
-How do I do that?
-I don't know.

788
00:52:59.115 --> 00:53:01.640
But you can't lose if you don't play.

789
00:53:02.886 --> 00:53:06.322
I always heard it
that you can't win if you don't play.

790
00:53:06.689 --> 00:53:09.180
The department puts you on a case
it doesn't want.

791
00:53:09.292 --> 00:53:12.352
You're given people
that are useless or untrustworthy.

792
00:53:12.462 --> 00:53:13.690
Correct.

793
00:53:14.130 --> 00:53:16.462
If you push too hard,
and any shit hits the fan...

794
00:53:16.566 --> 00:53:18.500
you'll be blamed for it.

795
00:53:18.768 --> 00:53:19.894
Correct.

796
00:53:20.003 --> 00:53:24.497
If you don't push hard enough, and there's
no arrest, you'll be blamed for that, too.

797
00:53:24.641 --> 00:53:25.869
Correct.

798
00:53:26.076 --> 00:53:27.771
The game is rigged.

799
00:53:28.411 --> 00:53:31.073
But you cannot lose if you do not play.

800
00:54:15.525 --> 00:54:17.254
In the hole, y'all.

801
00:55:22.859 --> 00:55:23.917
Hey!

802
00:55:25.094 --> 00:55:26.857
Hey, you fuckheads!

803
00:55:30.900 --> 00:55:32.299
Hey, police!

804
00:56:02.232 --> 00:56:03.756
-Hello.
-Lieutenant Daniels?

805
00:56:03.866 --> 00:56:04.924
Yeah.

806
00:56:15.745 --> 00:56:17.178
Who was that?

807
00:56:17.347 --> 00:56:20.612
It was the duty officer
down at University hospital.

808
00:56:20.717 --> 00:56:22.207
What happened?

809
00:56:23.686 --> 00:56:26.246
-He's blind in one eye.
-Who?

810
00:56:27.724 --> 00:56:30.921
The kid. The 14-year-old.
